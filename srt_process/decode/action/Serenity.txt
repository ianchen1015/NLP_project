And not just killed...
they've done things.
Reavers. They made them.
I won't live to report this,
We meant it for the best...
to make people safer.
[Reavers growling]
God!
[woman screaming]
[Reaver growling]
Turn it off.
[sobbing]
[retching]
River.
I'm all right.
(Mal)
Parliament buried it,
This is what
And they were
because there's a whole
They're gonna see it.
Somebody has to speak
You all got on this boat
but you all come
So now I'm asking more of you
Maybe all.
Sure as I know anything
Maybe on another world,
A year from now, 10,
that they can make people...
better.
And I do not hold to that.
So no more running.
I aim to misbehave.
Shepherd Book
"lf you can't do
"do something right."
Do we have a plan?
We haven't the equipment
but he can put it
He's pretty damn close, too.
We still got the Reavers...
and probably the Alliance,
(Jayne)
It's a fair bet
They're gonna
No.
They're not gonna
[engine revving]
No problem. Bring it on.
From here to the eyes
or it might be,
We won't be long.
You're going to get caught
It'll play merry hob
but pretty lights
You'll let us know
You'll be the first.
There.
Toss me my 30 coin,
[gasping]
Call in every ship
Destroy it all.
(Mal)
Now!
(Wash)
I'm reading activity
You should have
We should have done this
(helmsman)
[electronic beeping]
Vessel in range.
Bastard's not even
Sir!
Target the Reavers.
Target everyone!
I am a leaf on the wind.
Chicken's come home
The hell?
I am a leaf on the wind!
We're almost through.
No! No! No!
[rumbling]
We're not alone.
EMP!
Everybody, strap yourselves
Jayne.
Kaylee, come on.
We're fried.
Where's the backup?
Check! Check!
[engine whining]
[Jayne screaming]
[whooshing]
(Mal)
(Kaylee)
Backup reads at 20%.
I'm going to have
[screaming]
[panting]
I am a leaf on the wind.
Watch how--
[gasps]
Wash, baby. Baby, no.
We gotta move. Baby, please.
(Mal)
Move out! Now!
Go. Go.
Head inside!
Jayne, rearguard.
Zoe, what've we got?
this is a good hold point.
We all stay together.
They have to come
They'll bottleneck,
We get pushed back,
I can rig them
Shut them
We need to draw them
This is the place.
All right, let's move
Make sure they ain't filled
Wait, Wash!
He ain't coming.
Move the gorramn crates!
[Reavers howling]
Tell me you brought them
[Reavers growling]
[explosion]
[grunting]
Zoe?
Are you here?
You hold.
Captain's right.
Can't be thinking on revenge
Do you really think
I might.
[static crackling]
No.
Mal.
Guy killed me, Mal.
He killed me with a sword.
I got a short span here.
They destroyed my equipment...
but I have a backup unit.
Bottom of the complex,
Hard to get to.
They can't stop
They can never
[Reavers growling]
The Reavers.
It's okay. It's okay.
[banging on door]
Stay low.
She picked a sweet
Jayne and I take
Nobody shoots unless
I didn't plan
I think we did right, but....
No. I never planned...
I just wanted
Spent so much time on Serenity
that I wanted for myself.
My one regret
is never being with you.
With me?
You mean to say, as....
Sex?
I mean to say.
[metal squeaks]
Hell with this.
Mal. Guy killed me, Mal.
He killed me with a sword.
[Reavers growling]
"Hard to get to."
That's a fact.
Zoe, gorrammit!
[Reavers shrieking]
[screams]
Zoe, get your ass
[screams]
[groaning]
You shot me in the back!
I haven't made you
There are a lot
You have no idea
I know the secret.
The truth that burned up
Rest of the 'verse
Do you really believe that?
You willing to die
I am.
[screams]
[gun firing]
Of course,
[groaning]
[gun firing]
Spine's intact.
[gasping]
[grunting]
[both grunting]
[sobbing]
(Jayne)
[groans]
[gasps]
Kaylee!
[screaming]
Fall back! Everybody,
Jayne, grenade.
Very last one.
They're gonna get in.
I can close it
No one's coming
How much ammo
Three, four max,
The lift isn't moving.
When they come,
I'm starting to lose
Lie still. I'm going
My bag.
[gun fires]
[gun firing]
Keep pressure here.
(Simon)
I need...
adrenaline and a shot of...
calaphar for Kaylee.
[gasping]
River.
River, I'm sorry.
No.
I hate to leave.
You take care of me, Simon.
You've always
My turn.
[Operative and Mal grunting]
Do you know
Hell. I'm a fan
[groans]
But right now...
I'm going to have
We ain't got long.
[thudding]
You suppose he got through?
Do you think Mal
He got through.
[groans]
[coughs]
I'm sorry.
[groans]
You should know
You've done remarkable things.
But you're fighting a war...
you've already lost.
[groans]
[gasping]
Well, I'm known for that.
[groaning]
Piece of shrapnel tore up
Had it moved.
Sorry about the throat.
Expect you'd want to say your
Just one trouble.
I ain't gonna kill you.
[gasping]
Hell, I'm gonna grant
[beeping]
I'm gonna show you
These are just a few of
And you can see...
it isn't what we thought.
There's been no war here...
and no terraforming event.
It's the Pax.
The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate
It was supposed to calm
[roaring]
We meant it for the best...
to make people safer.
[Reavers growling]
God!
[woman screaming]
[Reaver growling]
[panting]
Sir?
Report.
River?
(soldier #1)
(soldier #2)
Weapons down.
I want to see
Stand down.
Targets are acquired.
Do we have a kill order?
Do we have an order?
(Operative)
Stand down. It's finished.
We're finished.
It's not over,
I can't guarantee
The Parliament.
Your broadwave about Miranda
They are not gone
That don't bode
giving the order to let us go,
I told them the Tams
They might listen...
but I think they know
They take you down,
Like to kill you myself,
You won't.
There is nothing left to see.
Sir, we have
Inspection's pos
Think she'll hold together?
She's tore up plenty.
Make sure
Could be bumpy.
Taking her out...
should be about a day's ride
Right.
Ready to get off this heap,
I, uh....
I don't know.
Good answer.
So, you gonna ride
That's the plan.
Think you can work out--
[engine revving]
Okay.
Clearly some
It ain't all buttons
You know what the first rule
Well, I suppose you do,
(River)
But I like to hear you say it.
Love.
You can learn all the math
but you take a boat in
she'll shake you off
Love keeps her in the air
tells you she's hurting
Makes her a home.
[rain pattering]
Storm's getting worse.
We'll pass through it
(Mal)
