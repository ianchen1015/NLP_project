{\bord0\shad0\fs20\fad(800,800)\fn方正兰亭粗黑_GBK\b0\pos(193,185.333)\c&HBCC0C1&}时  空  恋{\fn方正兰亭纤黑_GBK}  旅  人

2
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,580
我一直都知道  我家里人都有点奇怪
{\fs10}I aways knew we were a fairly odd family.{\r}

3
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,640
先说说我吧
{\fs10}First there was me.{\r}

4
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,010
太高  太瘦  太红毛
{\fs10}Too tall. Too skinny. Too orange.{\r}

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,020
我妈很可爱  但和其他当妈的不一样
{\fs10}My mum was lovely, but not like other mums.{\r}

6
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,540
她的性格呢  有点固执
{\fs10}There was something solid about her.{\r}

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,690
有点呆板  有点冷艳  总是忙忙碌碌
{\fs10}Something rectangular, busy and unsentimental.{\r}

8
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,570
她的时尚标杆是英国女王
{\fs10}Her fashion icon was the Queen.{\r}

9
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,300
我爸呢  他看上去就正常多了
{\fs10}Dad, well, he was more normal.{\r}

10
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,900
他总是那么闲
{\fs10}He always seemed to have time on his hands.{\r}

11
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,250
自从他五十岁生日那天
{\fs10}After giving up teaching{\r}

12
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,320
辞去了大学教师的工作后
{\fs10}university students on his 50th birthday,{\r}

13
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,700
要么随时陪你聊天
{\fs10}he was eternally available for a leisurely chat or{\r}

14
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,040
要么就是在乒乓大战中被我虐
{\fs10}to let me win at table tennis.{\r}

15
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,290
漂亮
{\fs10}Yes.{\r}

16
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,250
接下来是我舅舅  德斯蒙德
{\fs10}And then there was Mum's brother, Uncle Desmond.{\r}

17
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,380
总是正装打扮  总在混日子
{\fs10}Always impeccably dressed. He spent the days just, well,{\r}

18
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,090
反正有他自己的一套
{\fs10}being Uncle Desmond.{\r}

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,280
在家里他最有魅力了
{\fs10}He was the most charming{\r}

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,090
但却又傻得不行
{\fs10}and least clever man you could ever meet.{\r}

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,010
他思想捉摸不透  咱可懂不了
{\fs10}His mind was on other things, though we never found out what.{\r}

22
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,020
最后一位是我妹凯特琳
{\fs10}And then, finally there was Catherine.{\r}

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,850
又叫凯蒂或奇巧
{\fs10}Katie. Kit Kat. My sister.{\r}

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,520
在这个从着装到发型都中规中矩的家庭里
{\fs10}In a household of sensible jackets and haircuts there was this,{\r}

25
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,190
她简直就是个野生尤物
{\fs10}well, what can I call her, nature thing.{\r}

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,760
一双水灵灵的大眼
{\fs10}With her elfin eyes,{\r}

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,110
紫色的上衣  总是打着赤脚
{\fs10}her purple T-shirts and her eternally bare feet,{\r}

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,700
对于我来说  她一直都是
{\fs10}she was then, and still is to me,{\r}

29
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,490
这世界上最可爱的人
{\fs10}about the most wonderful thing in the world.{\r}

30
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,670
说到头  童年还是很快乐的
{\fs10}All in all, it was a pretty good childhood.{\r}

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,420
每日重复的节奏与模式
{\fs10}Full of repeated rhythms and patterns.{\r}

32
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,210
在我21岁前
{\fs10}By the time I was 21,{\r}

33
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,630
我们每天都会来海边享受下午茶
{\fs10}we were still having tea on the beach every single day.{\r}

34
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,550
丢石块打水漂  吃着三文治充饥
{\fs10}Skimming stones and eating sandwiches,{\r}

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,930
无论春夏秋冬  不管天气好坏
{\fs10}summer and winter, no matter what the weather.{\r}

36
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,890
每周五晚都是我们的电影之夜
{\fs10}And every Friday evening, a film,{\r}

37
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,770
也是不管天气好与坏
{\fs10}no matter what the weather.{\r}

38
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,940
直到那一年不堪回首的跨年派对
{\fs10}And then once a year, the dreaded New Year's Eve party.{\r}

39
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,750
等一会  我再去拿一瓶
{\fs10}Yeah, I might just get one.{\r}

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,670
你真太美了
{\fs10}You're absolutely gorgeous.{\r}

41
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,260
我叫凯蒂  我喝什么呢
{\fs10}I'm Katie. What am I drinking?{\r}

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,930
这杯酒可贵了
{\fs10}This is very expensive stuff.{\r}

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,390
-干杯  -干杯
{\fs10}- Cheers. - Cheers.{\r}

44
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,740
快来  马上就12点了
{\fs10}Come on, it's nearly midnight.{\r}

45
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,830
我们要倒数了  开始倒数了
{\fs10}We're all going through. We're going through.{\r}

46
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,910
我要帮你找个...
{\fs10}Look, I've gotta find you a...{\r}

47
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,790
天啊
{\fs10}God!{\r}

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,750
人紧张就会犯错  没事  快来
{\fs10}Everyone makes little mistakes. It's fine. Come on.{\r}

49
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,130

{\fs10}6 5 4 3 2 1
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.{\r}

50
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,300
新年快乐
{\fs10}Happy New Year!{\r}

51
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,510
新年快乐
{\fs10}Happy New Year.{\r}

52
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,430
对不起
{\fs10}Sorry.{\r}

53
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,280
第二天早上醒来
{\fs10}And so I woke up the next morning,{\r}

54
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,110
酒还没醒  感到羞愧
{\fs10}hung-over, ashamed of myself,{\r}

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,910
没有意识到今天是
{\fs10}and not realising it was the day{\r}

56
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,530
会彻底改变人生的一天
{\fs10}that would change my life forever.{\r}

57
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,870
起床啦  蠢猪
{\fs10}Get up, stupid.{\r}

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,000
老爸找你
{\fs10}Dad wants you.{\r}

59
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,710
你好哇  性感睡衣
{\fs10}Hello. Sexy pyjamas.{\r}

60
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,890
蒂姆  快进来
{\fs10}Tim, come in.{\r}

61
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,300
请
{\fs10}Do...{\r}

62
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,640
坐下
{\fs10}Sit down.{\r}

63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
搞得挺正式啊
{\fs10}That's very formal.{\r}

64
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,150
是这样的
{\fs10}Well, um, yeah.{\r}

65
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,020
我也有点紧张
{\fs10}This is an odd moment for me{\r}

66
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,230
因为我刚满21岁时
{\fs10}because I had the same moment with my father{\r}

67
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,430
我爸爸也和我有过这样的谈话
{\fs10}when I'd just turned 21,{\r}

68
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,710
之后我的人生就此改变了
{\fs10}and after it, my life was never the same,{\r}

69
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,620
所以我现在也挺紧张
{\fs10}so I approach it pretty, um, nervously.{\r}

70
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,700
好吧
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

71
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,240
你好好酝酿  貌似挺神秘的
{\fs10}When you're ready. It's all very mysterious.{\r}

72
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,040
是的
{\fs10}Right.{\r}

73
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,460
蒂姆  我亲爱的儿子
{\fs10}Tim, my dear son, the...{\r}

74
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,630
简单说就是咱家的男人
{\fs10}The simple fact is the men in this family{\r}

75
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,220
一直都有一种能力
{\fs10}have always had the ability to...{\r}

76
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,650
这听起来很荒唐  做好准备
{\fs10}This is going to sound strange, be prepared for strangeness.{\r}

77
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,310
别吓坏了
{\fs10}Get ready for spooky time,{\r}

78
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,350
这可是咱家的秘密
{\fs10}but there's this family secret.{\r}

79
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,020
秘密就是咱家的男人能
{\fs10}And the secret is that the men in the family can{\r}

80
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,650
穿越时空
{\fs10}travel in time.{\r}

81
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,870
准确的说  能穿越到过去
{\fs10}Well, more accurately, travel back in time.{\r}

82
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,990
不能穿越到未来
{\fs10}We can't travel into the future.{\r}

83
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,870
这玩笑挺怪异的
{\fs10}This is such a weird joke.{\r}

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,250
这不是玩笑
{\fs10}It's seriously not a joke.{\r}

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,750
意思是  你和爷爷还有他的兄弟
{\fs10}So you're saying that you and granddad, and his brothers{\r}

86
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,210
-你们都能穿越到过去  -没错
{\fs10}- could all travel back in time? - Absolutely.{\r}

87
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,260
-你现在还能?  -是的
{\fs10}- And you still do? - Absolutely.{\r}

88
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,380
实际并没说起来那么夸张
{\fs10}Although it's not as dramatic as it sounds.{\r}

89
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,510
只能在自己的人生中穿越
{\fs10}It's only in my own life.{\r}

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
只能去我去过且还记得的地方
{\fs10}I can only go to places where I actually was and can remember.{\r}

91
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,920
很可惜  我无法暗杀希特勒
{\fs10}I can't kill Hitler or shag Helen of Troy,{\r}

92
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,440
无法和特洛伊的海伦滚床单
{\fs10}unfortunately.{\r}

93
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,770
好  打住
{\fs10}Okay, stop.{\r}

94
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,350
如果是真的  当然这不可能
{\fs10}If it's true, which it isn't.{\r}

95
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,940
就是真的
{\fs10}Although it is.{\r}

96
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,420
显然不是
{\fs10}Although it isn't, obviously.{\r}

97
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,360
-假设是真的  虽然其实是假的  -是真的
{\fs10}- But if it was, which it's not. - Which it is.{\r}

98
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:07,950
不可能
{\fs10}Which it isn't.{\r}

99
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,450
但若是真的  那我要怎样...
{\fs10}But if it was, how would I...{\r}

100
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,700
其实很简单的
{\fs10}The "How" Is the easy bit, in fact.{\r}

101
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,670
你找个黑暗的地方
{\fs10}You go into a dark place,{\r}

102
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,040
壁柜里是最佳场所
{\fs10}big cupboards are very useful generally.{\r}

103
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,580
必要时用厕所
{\fs10}Toilets, at a pinch.{\r}

104
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,040
然后像我这样握紧拳头
{\fs10}Then you clench your fists like this.{\r}

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,620
想着你要去的地方
{\fs10}Think of the moment you're going to{\r}

106
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,250
然后你就穿越过去了
{\fs10}and you'll find yourself there.{\r}

107
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,630
当然还会有些磕磕碰碰什么的
{\fs10}After a bit of a stumble and a rumble and a tumble.{\r}

108
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
很冷静嘛
{\fs10}Is as good a reaction as any.{\r}

109
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,600
我那时大喊了一句"我操"  而且是在70年代
{\fs10}I think I plumped for "Fuck!" But it was the '70s.{\r}

110
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,260
别吹了  完全就是开玩笑的
{\fs10}No, this is so obviously a joke.{\r}

111
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,890
都说了不是玩笑
{\fs10}It's not a joke.{\r}

112
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,770
干嘛我要骗...
{\fs10}Why would I lie to someone I'm...{\r}

113
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,520
我喜欢的人
{\fs10}fairly fond of?{\r}

114
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,730
好吧
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

115
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,570
但是  要是我在壁柜里握紧拳头
{\fs10}But, when I come back downstairs{\r}

116
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,320
出来还是老样子
{\fs10}after standing in a cupboard with my fists clenched,{\r}

117
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,650
那你可就麻烦了
{\fs10}you're gonna be in so much trouble.{\r}

118
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,410
走着瞧
{\fs10}Well, let's see, shall we?{\r}

119
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,660
对了  试着做些有趣的事情
{\fs10}And, Tim, try and do something interesting.{\r}

120
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,500
你就有大麻烦了
{\fs10}So much trouble.{\r}

121
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,580
我说到做到
{\fs10}I mean it. Really.{\r}

122
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,930
试试吧
{\fs10}Right.{\r}

123
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,520
没醉吧  蒂姆
{\fs10}You all right, Tim?{\r}

124
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,860
没  很好  很清醒  很棒
{\fs10}Yes. Yeah. Good, ace. Yeah.{\r}

125
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,850
那好  快来
{\fs10}Good, come on.{\r}

126
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,770
马上就12点了  我们要找到...
{\fs10}It's nearly midnight and we've got to find...{\r}

127
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,070
小心小心
{\fs10}Whoa, whoa, whoa!{\r}

128
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,530
马上十二点了
{\fs10}Whoo! Midnight.{\r}

129
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,740

{\fs10}10 9 8 7
10, 9, 8, 7,{\r}

130
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,620

{\fs10}6 5 4 3 2 1
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.{\r}

131
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,960
新年快乐
{\fs10}Happy New Year!{\r}

132
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,220
谢谢你  蒂姆
{\fs10}Thank you, Tim.{\r}

133
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,760
不用谢  波莉
{\fs10}You're welcome, Polly.{\r}

134
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,540
老妈知道吗
{\fs10}Does Mum know?{\r}

135
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,660
不知道
{\fs10}Not a whistle.{\r}

136
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,240
奇怪了  那万一...
{\fs10}Strange. And what about the whole...{\r}

137
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,800
产生蝴蝶效应是吧  怎么说呢
{\fs10}Butterfly effect thing. What can I say?{\r}

138
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,090
目前看来我们还没毁坏人类文明
{\fs10}We don't seem to have messed up civilisation yet.{\r}

139
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,490
今年会很复杂
{\fs10}It's gonna be a complicated year.{\r}

140
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
今生也会很复杂
{\fs10}It's gonna be a complicated life.{\r}

141
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,420
那你都回去干了些什么
{\fs10}What have you done with it?{\r}

142
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,640
对我来说  就是看书  看书  看书
{\fs10}For me, it's books, books, books.{\r}

143
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,930
把一个人想看的书都看完了
{\fs10}I've read everything a man could wish to.{\r}

144
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,280
看了两遍  狄更斯的三遍
{\fs10}Twice. Dickens three times.{\r}

145
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,680
你想干些什么
{\fs10}Any first thoughts?{\r}

146
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,710
我想
{\fs10}Well, I suppose apart from{\r}

147
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,770
除了弄个更潮流的发型外
{\fs10}getting a slightly better haircut...{\r}

148
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,320
很明显还要赚很多钱
{\fs10}Money would be the obvious thing.{\r}

149
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,690
这亦好亦坏
{\fs10}Very mixed blessing.{\r}

150
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,460
你爷爷这辈子就被这样毁了
{\fs10}Utterly screwed up your grandfather's life.{\r}

151
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,190
孤独终老
{\fs10}Left him without love or friends.{\r}

152
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,740
我也从未遇到过真正快乐的富豪
{\fs10}I've never bumped into a genuinely happy rich person.{\r}

153
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,910
如果可以不用工作也不错
{\fs10}It would be nice not to have to work.{\r}

154
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,740
不行  它是万劫之首啊
{\fs10}No, that's a real recipe for disaster.{\r}

155
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,170
看看你叔叔弗雷德就知道了
{\fs10}Look what happened to Uncle Fred.{\r}

156
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,310
他怎么了
{\fs10}What happened to Uncle Fred?{\r}

157
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,770
一事无成
{\fs10}Absolutely sod all.{\r}

158
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,070
混日子
{\fs10}Wasted his life.{\r}

159
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,150
必须把运用这种能力
{\fs10}You have to use it for things that you really think{\r}

160
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,070
把人生变成你真正想要的样子
{\fs10}will make your life the way you want it to be.{\r}

161
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,340
真的  要好好考虑
{\fs10}Come on, really think about this.{\r}

162
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,420
其实嘛
{\fs10}Well,{\r}

163
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,180
老实说  现在我只希望
{\fs10}to be honest, I suppose, at the moment,{\r}

164
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,220
这种超能力能帮我找到个女朋友
{\fs10}it would be just great if it could help me get a girlfriend.{\r}

165
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,190
这可不容易
{\fs10}Massive.{\r}

166
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,940
是啊  重头戏
{\fs10}The mothership.{\r}

167
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,030
我一直渴望得到真爱
{\fs10}For me, it was always gonna be about love.{\r}

168
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,950
今年夏天我就陷入了爱情的泥潭中
{\fs10}And that summer I walked into the eye of the storm.{\r}

169
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,140
她叫夏洛特
{\fs10}Her name was Charlotte.{\r}

170
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,870
是我妹那渣男友吉米的表妹
{\fs10}Cousin of Kit Kat's handsome but nasty boyfriend Jimmy.{\r}

171
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,710
她在我家待了整整两个月
{\fs10}And she was staying for two whole months.{\r}

172
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,550
就这个  不是全部
{\fs10}Just one. Not both of them.{\r}

173
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
蒂姆
{\fs10}Tim,{\r}

174
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,550
可以帮我擦防晒霜吗
{\fs10}will you do my back?{\r}

175
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,010
当然
{\fs10}Absolutely!{\r}

176
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,890
很殷勤嘛
{\fs10}Very keen!{\r}

177
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,940
不  不
{\fs10}Whoa! No. No.{\r}

178
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,900
不  不  不
{\fs10}No. No, no. No, no, no.{\r}

179
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,570
-弄到头发上了?  -是的
{\fs10}- Is it in my hair? - Yes!{\r}

180
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,040
蒂姆  可以帮我擦防晒霜吗
{\fs10}Tim. Will you do my back?{\r}

181
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,630
可以  等一会儿
{\fs10}Sure. Just give us a sec.{\r}

182
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
好的
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

183
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,940
谢谢
{\fs10}Thank you.{\r}

184
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
来了
{\fs10}Now...{\r}

185
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,280
好舒服啊
{\fs10}Ooh. Nice.{\r}

186
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,280
我最拿手了
{\fs10}It's my area.{\r}

187
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,160
这是一个又晒又折磨人的夏天
{\fs10}It was a summer of suntan and torture.{\r}

188
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,040
我之所以叫我那呆瓜朋友杰来打网球
{\fs10}I invited my foolish friend Jay around for tennis{\r}

189
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,380
是因为我原以为他能衬托出我很厉害
{\fs10}because I thought he'd make me look good.{\r}

190
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,260
但我错了
{\fs10}I was wrong!{\r}

191
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,600
-你怎么打的啊  -抱歉抱歉
{\fs10}- What are you doing? - No.{\r}

192
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,230
夏洛特把我俩玩得团团转
{\fs10}Charlotte just made both of us look like idiots.{\r}

193
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,810
运气不好啊  蒂姆
{\fs10}Bad luck, Tim.{\r}

194
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,980
妈的  这怎么能让人集中精神打球嘛
{\fs10}How the hell are you meant to concentrate on your game?{\r}

195
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,740
这样下去
{\fs10}How are you meant to live your life{\r}

196
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,990
让我怎么过今后的生活啊
{\fs10}with this sort of shit going down?{\r}

197
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,330
情况一直这样
{\fs10}It never got better until suddenly{\r}

198
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,910
直到快来不及了
{\fs10}it was almost too late.{\r}

199
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,790
夏洛特  这是我们最后一次午餐了
{\fs10}Well, Charlotte, our final lunch.{\r}

200
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,170
不要
{\fs10}No!{\r}

201
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,800
有你的这个夏天很开心
{\fs10}And it's been really, really lovely having you all summer.{\r}

202
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,960
是的
{\fs10}It has.{\r}

203
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,130
谢谢  谢谢
{\fs10}Thank you. Thank you.{\r}

204
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,510
真的  真的很开心
{\fs10}It has. It really has.{\r}

205
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,930
德斯蒙德  很开心吧
{\fs10}Hasn't it, Desmond?{\r}

206
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,220
你说啥
{\fs10}Beg your pardon?{\r}

207
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,470
这个夏天有夏洛特很开心
{\fs10}Lovely having Charlotte here all summer.{\r}

208
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,310
夏洛特? 谁是夏洛特啊
{\fs10}Charlotte? Who's Charlotte?{\r}

209
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,680
长点记性  夏洛特就坐在你旁边
{\fs10}Come on, darling. Charlotte, sitting next to you.{\r}

210
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,310
是哦  记起来了  你是夏洛特
{\fs10}Yes, of course. Of course. Charlotte.{\r}

211
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,520
很高兴认识你
{\fs10}Lovely to meet you.{\r}

212
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,320
蒂姆  这个夏天有夏洛特在你开心吗
{\fs10}Have you enjoyed having Charlotte here all summer, Tim?{\r}

213
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,370
八月要结束了
{\fs10}There goes August.{\r}

214
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,500
我都教了他好多事情了
{\fs10}I've introduced him to most things, haven't I?{\r}

215
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,040
是的  你比他有经验嘛
{\fs10}You did. You were much more sophisticated.{\r}

216
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,880
而且不露声色
{\fs10}In a quiet way, I like to think.{\r}

217
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,060
进来
{\fs10}Come in.{\r}

218
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,650
夏洛特
{\fs10}Charlotte.{\r}

219
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,200
最后一晚了  能问你一个问题吗
{\fs10}As it's your last night, can I ask you a question?{\r}

220
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,820
问吧
{\fs10}Yeah. Ask away.{\r}

221
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,490
等等
{\fs10}No, wait.{\r}

222
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,910
不会是向我表白吧
{\fs10}It's not going to be about love, is it?{\r}

223
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,580
表白? 表白什么
{\fs10}Love? What?{\r}

224
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,900
奇巧警告过我
{\fs10}Well, it's just that Kit Kat warned me{\r}

225
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,500
如果你向我表白
{\fs10}that if you were to ever mention it,{\r}

226
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,550
那我就必须以强硬姿态告诉你
{\fs10}I should be very firm with you and tell you{\r}

227
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,840
必须把我当成你的妹妹
{\fs10}you must treat me like your sister{\r}

228
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,380
别做傻事
{\fs10}and not be stupid.{\r}

229
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,260
还是我完全误会了
{\fs10}Or have I just made a total fool of myself{\r}

230
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,990
你其实只是趁最后一晚
{\fs10}and you were actually going to ask me for{\r}

231
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,680
跑来问我关于打网球的技巧是吧
{\fs10}late night last minute tennis tips?{\r}

232
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,350
不是  我就是来表白的
{\fs10}No, it was the love thing.{\r}

233
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,100
好吧
{\fs10}Well.{\r}

234
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,560
你人真好
{\fs10}That's very sweet of you.{\r}

235
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,690
可惜你拖到最后一晚才表白
{\fs10}It's just a shame you left it till the last night.{\r}

236
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,560
你应该在我们还有时间的时候
{\fs10}You should have tried creeping along the corridor{\r}

237
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,620
多多溜到我门外来
{\fs10}while we still had time.{\r}

238
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,790
所以不该最后一晚表白?
{\fs10}Okay, the "Last night" was a bad idea?{\r}

239
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,460
是的
{\fs10}Very bad idea.{\r}

240
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,790
都快分开了才说  感觉有点侮辱人呢
{\fs10}It feels like an ever so slightly insulting afterthought.{\r}

241
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,460
最后一晚表白是行不通的
{\fs10}"Last night" was never going to work.{\r}

242
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,130
好的  就这样  我明白了
{\fs10}All right. Good. I've got it.{\r}

243
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,900
进来
{\fs10}Come in.{\r}

244
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,240
-蒂姆  -夏洛特
{\fs10}- Tim. - Charlotte.{\r}

245
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,320
坐这儿
{\fs10}Sit down.{\r}

246
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,660
可能你已经感觉到了
{\fs10}I know you've probably suspected this,{\r}

247
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,420
过去一个月我完完全全地爱上了你
{\fs10}but over the last month I've fallen completely in love with you.{\r}

248
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,840
现在是时候表白了
{\fs10}Now obviously this was gonna happen{\r}

249
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,090
你是我的女神  天使般的脸蛋
{\fs10}because you're a goddess with that face{\r}

250
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,970
一头柔软的长发
{\fs10}and that hair,{\r}

251
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,260
即使你没有漂亮的脸蛋
{\fs10}but even if you didn't have a nice face,{\r}

252
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,930
或是因为什么医疗事故
{\fs10}and even if you had absolutely no hair{\r}

253
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,770
你变成了秃子
{\fs10}because of some bizarre medical reason,{\r}

254
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,150
我依然喜欢你
{\fs10}I'd still adore you,{\r}

255
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,690
我...
{\fs10}and I...{\r}

256
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,910
我想知道我是否有一丝希望
{\fs10}I just wondered whether, by any chance,{\r}

257
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,860
让你也如此动心
{\fs10}you might share my feelings.{\r}

258
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,410
不如这样
{\fs10}I tell you what.{\r}

259
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,040
不如等到夏天结束
{\fs10}Why don't we see how the summer goes{\r}

260
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,960
到最后一晚再来表白
{\fs10}and then you ask me again on my last night?{\r}

261
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,630
-最后一晚? -是的
{\fs10}- Your last night? - Yes.{\r}

262
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,010
最后一晚再表白  或许会发生些奇迹哦
{\fs10}Try me on the last night. See what happens then, shall we?{\r}

263
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,220
我好期待呢
{\fs10}It's exciting.{\r}

264
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
对
{\fs10}Right.{\r}

265
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,430
不  是个完美计划
{\fs10}No, it's a perfect plan.{\r}

266
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,430
非常完美  最后一晚再表白
{\fs10}That's absolutely perfect. Last night.{\r}

267
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,980
最后一晚
{\fs10}Last night.{\r}

268
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,440
谢谢
{\fs10}Thanks very much.{\r}

269
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,110
晚安  蒂米
{\fs10}Night-night, Timmy.{\r}

270
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,410
经验教训第一条
{\fs10}Big lesson number one,{\r}

271
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,710
不管怎样穿越都也无法让人爱上你
{\fs10}all the time travel in the world can't make someone love you.{\r}

272
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,830
再见
{\fs10}Bye!{\r}

273
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,250
我的挚爱就这样离开我了
{\fs10}So the love of my life just drove away.{\r}

274
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,510
她走后第二天我也要走了
{\fs10}And the very next day it was my turn to leave.{\r}

275
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,260
拿着  别一次花完
{\fs10}There you go. Don't spend it all at once.{\r}

276
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,970
谢了
{\fs10}Thanks.{\r}

277
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,530
别老给家里打电话
{\fs10}Don't call too often,{\r}

278
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,400
你妈不喜欢老被人打扰
{\fs10}your mother doesn't like to be disturbed.{\r}

279
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,690
好的  知道了
{\fs10}Okay. Thanks.{\r}

280
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,460
我坐着火车来到了伦敦
{\fs10}I caught the train to London{\r}

281
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,460
寻找未来  和我的爱情
{\fs10}in search of a future and a girlfriend.{\r}

282
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,380
我住在我爸的剧作家朋友哈利家里
{\fs10}I was staying in St John's Wood, near Abbey Road,{\r}

283
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,640
他家在艾比路附近的圣约翰伍德区
{\fs10}with a playwright friend of my dad's called Harry.{\r}

284
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,820
初到伦敦  能有亲友们投靠
{\fs10}It's always nice to have family connections{\r}

285
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,680
真是一件好事
{\fs10}when you're a new kid in town.{\r}

286
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,370
你  他妈  想干嘛
{\fs10}What the fuck do you want?{\r}

287
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,700
我是詹姆斯的儿子
{\fs10}I'm James's son.{\r}

288
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,000
谁啊
{\fs10}Who?{\r}

289
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,330
-詹姆斯·莱克  -他怎么了
{\fs10}- James Lake. - What about him?{\r}

290
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,750
他说你有一间空房
{\fs10}He said you had a room.{\r}

291
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,590
进去  进到这  别动
{\fs10}Go in there and wait.{\r}

292
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,930
安静点  别弄出任何声响
{\fs10}Quietly. I mean it, don't make a sound.{\r}

293
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,430
不然我就杀了你
{\fs10}Or I'll kill you.{\r}

294
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,570
我刚想到了一个十年来最好的点子
{\fs10}I was actually having the first good idea I've had for a decade{\r}

295
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,200
你却按响了门铃
{\fs10}when you rang on the doorbell.{\r}

296
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,620
好了  现在全没了
{\fs10}But now it's gone.{\r}

297
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,370
你个小杂种
{\fs10}You little shit.{\r}

298
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,080
你老爸过得怎样
{\fs10}How's your dad?{\r}

299
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,460
我总觉得他是另类  有点怪怪的
{\fs10}Weird cock, I always thought. Something weird about him.{\r}

300
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,370
是吗
{\fs10}Really?{\r}

301
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,960
当然  其实我不太喜欢他
{\fs10}Yeah, I never really liked him, actually.{\r}

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,510

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,510
你妈现在长得还像安迪·沃霍尔吗
{\fs10}Your mum still look like Andy Warhol?{\r}

304
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,630
什么啊
{\fs10}What?{\r}

305
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,590
对了  那是我老婆
{\fs10}That, by the way, is my wife.{\r}

306
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,220
她很漂亮
{\fs10}Nice.{\r}

307
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,790
你一开始肯定不会喜欢她的
{\fs10}Yeah, you wouldn't like her at first.{\r}

308
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,980
牙尖嘴利的
{\fs10}Sarcastic cow.{\r}

309
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,270
但最终你会发现
{\fs10}But eventually you'd realise that{\r}

310
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,440
她是这世上最好的人
{\fs10}she's the best human being in the world.{\r}

311
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,440
理所当然  她离开我了
{\fs10}Which is why she left me, of course.{\r}

312
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,570
这是你的房间
{\fs10}Here you go.{\r}

313
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,950
不要搞太大声  尤其是在滚床单的时候
{\fs10}Try not to make too much noise, particularly when having sex.{\r}

314
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,620
那不可能的
{\fs10}No chance of that.{\r}

315
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,410
天啊  两个屌丝住在一个房子里
{\fs10}Christ, two losers in one house.{\r}

316
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,500
那是我女儿
{\fs10}That is my daughter.{\r}

317
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,800
喜欢就睡她吧  反正人人都睡过她
{\fs10}Have sex with her if you like. Apparently everyone else has.{\r}

318
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,550
住在这种地方很难有桃花
{\fs10}It wasn't a hopeful set-up for romance.{\r}

319
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,970
工作上也没什么机会
{\fs10}And work didn't help on that score either.{\r}

320
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,100
法律界就是个男人的世界
{\fs10}The world of law seems to be entirely full of men.{\r}

321
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,650
我是罗利  荣幸荣幸  有点小激动
{\fs10}I'm Rory. Very pleased to meet you. A real thrill.{\r}

322
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,740
咱俩说不定会成为哥们  是吧
{\fs10}Well, who knows, we might become, you know, pals, et cetera.{\r}

323
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,820

{\fs10}- Who the hell are you? - Tim Lake.{\r}

324
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,070
希望你别和这蠢瓜一样蠢就好
{\fs10}Well, I hope you're better than this clown.{\r}

325
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,240
快过来  罗杰
{\fs10}Come on, Roger.{\r}

326
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,870
是罗利啦
{\fs10}It's Rory, actually.{\r}

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,540
我都来这一年半了
{\fs10}I've been here a year and a half.{\r}

328
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,660
这是客气的说法
{\fs10}I'm just saying that to be nice.{\r}

329
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,210
我来这其实已经2年了
{\fs10}It's two years actually.{\r}

330
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,950
半年寂寞地度过了
{\fs10}So six lonely months went by,{\r}

331
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,880
仍只有我跟哈利作伴
{\fs10}and it was still just me and Harry.{\r}

332
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,510
我日以继夜地忙着工作
{\fs10}Me lawyer-ing every hour of the day and night.{\r}

333
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,890
他则为新的演出作最后准备
{\fs10}And him putting the finishing touches to his new play.{\r}

334
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,520
无论有多少女孩与我擦肩而过
{\fs10}No matter how many girls there were in the world,{\r}

335
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,770
最终却只有罗利会停留
{\fs10}I always seemed to end up with Rory.{\r}

336
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
你好
{\fs10}Hello.{\r}

337
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,060
直到突然有一晚
{\fs10}Until, out of the blue,{\r}

338
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,630
在跟不靠谱的杰出去玩时
{\fs10}on a dodgy night out with dodgy Jay,{\r}

339
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,450
奇迹发生了
{\fs10}something miraculous happened.{\r}

340
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,950
这些侍应
{\fs10}The waiters are,{\r}

341
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,030
没错  都是盲人
{\fs10}wait for this, right, they're blind.{\r}

342
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,240
开什么玩笑
{\fs10}You're kidding me?{\r}

343
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,870
我没开玩笑  他们真的是完全看不见
{\fs10}I'm kidding you not. No, as bats. As bats!{\r}

344
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,960
先生  欢迎光临
{\fs10}Very good to have you here, gentlemen.{\r}

345
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,960
希望你们用餐愉快
{\fs10}I hope you enjoy your experience.{\r}

346
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,170
卡罗会带你们进去
{\fs10}Carlo will show you to your table.{\r}

347
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,550
-好的  -走吧  大师
{\fs10}- Great. - Lead on, maestro.{\r}

348
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,260
把你的右手搭到我的右肩上吧
{\fs10}Can I have your right hand on my right shoulder, please?{\r}

349
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,760
你朋友搭在你肩上  多谢合作
{\fs10}And your friend hold on to your shoulder. Thank you.{\r}

350
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,890
小心楼梯  做好心理准备
{\fs10}Mind the stairs and be prepared because,{\r}

351
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,390
里边真的什么都看不见
{\fs10}it's completely dark.{\r}


353
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,070
好的  先生  要是不介意的话
{\fs10}Okay, gentlemen, if you don't mind,{\r}

354
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,530
你们可以坐在这两位女士的旁边
{\fs10}I can sit you here beside these two young ladies.{\r}

355
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,690
当然不介意  好极了
{\fs10}No, no. Sounds absolutely perfect!{\r}

356
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,990
天啊  听起来还挺自信
{\fs10}God, you sound very perky.{\r}

357
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,450
确实  而且还十分英俊
{\fs10}I am. And very handsome.{\r}

358
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,200
这边有人啊
{\fs10}Someone's there.{\r}

359
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,500
-你好  -你好  我叫玛丽
{\fs10}- Hi. - Hi. I'm Mary.{\r}

360
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,290
我叫蒂姆  其实我妈也叫玛丽
{\fs10}I'm Tim. Mary's my mother's name, actually.{\r}

361
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,000
-人如其名吗  -还凑合
{\fs10}- Does it suit her? - Sort of.{\r}

362
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,060
不过她身子硬朗
{\fs10}Although she's sturdy,{\r}

363
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,590
也许叫伯纳德[男名]更合适
{\fs10}so Bernard might have been a better fit.{\r}

364
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,010
好吧
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

365
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,090
有东西碰到我手肘了
{\fs10}Something just touched my elbow.{\r}

367
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,550
放心  不是我
{\fs10}Okay, that wasn't me.{\r}

368
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,060
那更糟糕  要不是你  那是什么
{\fs10}No. Well, that just makes it worse. If it wasn't you, who was it?{\r}

369
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,390
也不是我  因为我在摸其他东西

我们赶时间  不过帮我拦出租车的话
{\fs10}We've got to rush, but help me find a cab,{\r}

416

我会考虑给你号码
{\fs10}and I might give you my number.{\r}

也可能不给  不过我还没决定
{\fs10}Or I might not. Haven't decided yet. So...{\r}

419
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,330
我才不会把号码给他
{\fs10}I have. it's not gonna happen.{\r}

420
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,610
-你好  -你好
{\fs10}- Hi. - Hi.{\r}

-她在哪  -她跟杰...
{\fs10}- Where's... - She and Jay just...{\r}

422
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,030
她跟他去了...我不知道
{\fs10}She took him to... I don't know.{\r}

423
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
好吧
{\fs10}Right.{\r}

424
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,490
我还是...
{\fs10}Well, I guess I'd better...{\r}

425
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,290
要是我问你要号码会不会太唐突了
{\fs10}Would it be very wrong if I asked you for your number?{\r}

426
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,290
不会
{\fs10}No.{\r}

427
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,670
以防我找你...
{\fs10}Just in case I ever had to call you about...{\r}

428
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,840
有事?
{\fs10}Stuff?{\r}

429
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,590
好吧
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

{\fs10}I thought this phone was old and shit,{\r}

435
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,570
不过现在它成了我最珍贵的东西了
{\fs10}but suddenly it's my most valuable possession.{\r}

436
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,400
你真的喜欢我吗
{\fs10}You really like me?{\r}

437
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,660
即使我穿的连衣裙
{\fs10}Even my frock?{\r}

438
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,910
我喜欢你的连衣裙
{\fs10}I love your frock.{\r}

439
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,120
我的头发呢  是不是太棕了
{\fs10}And my hair? It's not too brown?{\r}

440
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,000
我爱棕色
{\fs10}I love brown.{\r}

441
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,000
我刘海是新剪的
{\fs10}My fringe is new.{\r}

442

该走了
{\fs10}We have to go!{\r}

445
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,970

{\fs10}I found a cab and his dodgy friend is about to assault me.{\r}

00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,690
你会的
{\fs10}You will.{\r}

450
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,560
好的  很好
{\fs10}Okay. Good.{\r}

晚安
{\fs10}Goodnight.{\r}

452
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,520

{\fs10}What's happened?{\r}

453
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,860
你干嘛了  可怜的家伙
{\fs10}What have you done, you poor thing?{\r}

454
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,070
没什么  只不过多了道新伤口
{\fs10}Nothing. It's just a flesh wound.{\r}

455
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,490
-给  -谢谢
{\fs10}- Here. - Thank you.{\r}

456

进展顺利
{\fs10}Well. it went well.{\r}

00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,040
可以说杰作得以面世
{\fs10}You could tell in the room a masterpiece was being unfurled.{\r}

460
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,170
-真的吗  -真的
{\fs10}- Really? - Really.{\r}

461
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,840
直到演至全剧最关键的转折点
{\fs10}Until, and this is the crucial plot point, I think,{\r}

462
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,340

{\fs10}until the lead actor had the most massive dry{\r}

463
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,720
最严重的忘词状况
{\fs10}in the history of theatre.{\r}

464
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,390
-不会吧  -是的  就是这样
{\fs10}- No, no, no. - Yes, yes, yes.{\r}

465
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,430
这不仅仅是他忘词的问题
{\fs10}He didn't just forget his lines.{\r}

466
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,650

都显得不值一提
{\fs10}before in the annals of dramatic art.{\r}

469
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,030

{\fs10}The reviews won't say "Major masterpiece gets unveiled",{\r}

{\fs10}they'll say, "Major actor gets Alzheimer's."{\r}

471

简直是场灾难
{\fs10}It's a disaster.{\r}

472
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,580
这样讲还是太轻描淡写了
{\fs10}It's an understatement.{\r}

473

496
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,620
算是重温一下
{\fs10}A little refresher.{\r}

497
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,120
快滚出去
{\fs10}Fuck off out of here.{\r}

498
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,000
你这个疯子  快滚  蠢货  滚
{\fs10}You arsing lunatic. Get out! You ginger twerp. Go on!{\r}

499
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,880
保护这种...
{\fs10}Patronising piece of...{\r}

500
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,390
请辩方发言
{\fs10}And now the Defence.{\r}

501
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,450
我也是从失公允的年代中走来的
{\fs10}I have lived many weary years.{\r}

502
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,050
太棒了
{\fs10}It's brilliant.{\r}

503
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:11,950
即便在冗长的法律诉讼史中
{\fs10}But never, in that long catalogue of wasted time,{\r}

504
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,080
也未曾遇到过如此罪恶的审判不公
{\fs10}have I ever seen such an atrocious miscarriage of justice.{\r}

505
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,630
控诉方还要作何补充
{\fs10}Do the Prosecution have anything final to add?{\r}

506
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,310
抱歉  借过一下
{\fs10}Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.{\r}

507
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,230
控诉方还要作何补充
{\fs10}Do the Prosecution have anything final to add?{\r}

508
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,880
各位...
{\fs10}Gentlemen...{\r}

509
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,250
各位
{\fs10}Gentlemen,{\r}

510
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,300
对今日的诉讼我一直秉承最认真的态度
{\fs10}I regard today's proceedings with the utmost gravity.{\r}

511
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,180
然而
{\fs10}Nevertheless,{\r}

512
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,640
有一点虽简单
{\fs10}let us be clear of one{\r}

513
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,350
但却不容忽视
{\fs10}simple and salient thing.{\r}

514
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,110
那就是
{\fs10}It is the life{\r}

515
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,650
罪人的生命权
{\fs10}of a guilty man!{\r}

516
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,540
我看有个演员像是睡着了一样
{\fs10}One of the actors appeared to have actually fallen asleep.{\r}

517
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,090
中途离场的小混蛋过来了
{\fs10}Here's the little prick who walked out halfway through.{\r}

518
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,090
你错过了最精彩的一幕  蠢货
{\fs10}You missed the best scene, you little twerp.{\r}

519
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
抱歉
{\fs10}Sorry.{\r}

520
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,800
你觉得布景怎样
{\fs10}What did you think of the set?{\r}

521
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,340
太不可思议了
{\fs10}I thought it was incredible.{\r}

522
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,560
真的吗  我倒不觉得  太棕了
{\fs10}Did you? I didn't. Too brown.{\r}

523
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,060
玛丽
{\fs10}Mary!{\r}

524
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,770
不会吧
{\fs10}No.{\r}

525
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,150
她消失了
{\fs10}She's gone.{\r}

526
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,990
今晚有没有看到过两个女孩
{\fs10}Two girls in earlier tonight.{\r}

527
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,340
其中一个是这世上最漂亮的女孩
{\fs10}One of them the prettiest girl in the world.{\r}

528
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,310
另一个有点像稍有姿色的妓女
{\fs10}The other one like a sort of nice prostitute.{\r}

529
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,340
有登记她们的名字吗
{\fs10}Did you get their names?{\r}

530
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,260
是的  她们刚走不久  等我找找
{\fs10}Yes. They left a while ago. Let's see.{\r}

531
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,760
她们不是预订的  所以没有留下名字
{\fs10}No, I'm afraid they were walk-ins,{\r}

532
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,350
而且是用现金结的账
{\fs10}and it appears they paid by cash.{\r}

533
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,480
抱歉  先生
{\fs10}Sorry, sir.{\r}

534
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,360
没事  没事  很好
{\fs10}That's okay. That's fine, it's brilliant.{\r}

535
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,820
只不过是我的世界末日罢了  谢谢了
{\fs10}It's just the end of my life. Thanks so much.{\r}

536
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,050
开心点  伙计
{\fs10}Cheer up, mate.{\r}

539
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,050
通常我都不看他们写的东西
{\fs10}I don't usually read them, obviously,{\r}

540
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,720
不过这是例外

真是奇怪了
{\fs10}That's distinctly weird.{\r}

576
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,830
你是怎么知道的
{\fs10}How do you know that?{\r}

577
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,700

00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,800
顺便提一下  刘海不错
{\fs10}It's a nice fringe, by the way.{\r}

583
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,390
老天  我新剪的  可能太短了
{\fs10}God, it's new and probably too short but... No.{\r}

00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,390
谢谢你的夸奖
{\fs10}Well, gee, thank you and...{\r}

587
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,150
况且咱们根本不认识
{\fs10}And you're a, you're a total stranger.{\r}

588
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,820
根本不认识
{\fs10}Total stranger.{\r}

589
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,320
是啊  这也太疯狂了

593
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,240
怎么样了
{\fs10}How did it go?{\r}

594
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,500
太惨了
{\fs10}It was very poor.{\r}

595
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,910
真的十分惨
{\fs10}Very poor indeed, yeah.{\r}

596
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,410
那就再来一次
{\fs10}You gotta go again.{\r}

597
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,250
-你可以的  -再来一次
{\fs10}- You can do it. - Take two.{\r}

598
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,010
她总是...总是那么的与众不同
{\fs10}She just always... She always looks different.{\r}

{\fs10}Hello. Nice to meet you.{\r}

604
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,940
蒂姆是碰巧妈妈跟我同名的陌生人
{\fs10}Tim is a total stranger whose mother's name is Mary.{\r}

605
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,550
我在这把玛丽认作是其他人了
{\fs10}I just had a weird experience with Mary here{\r}

606
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,410
但其实她不是
{\fs10}of thinking she was someone else. But she wasn't.{\r}

607
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,320
不过我想能不能和你们一起参观
{\fs10}But I just wondered if I could walk round with you for a while,{\r}

608
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,620
因为我妹妹要走了
{\fs10}because my sister Kit Kat is about to leave.{\r}

609
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,750
是啊
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

再见
{\fs10}Bye.{\r}

611
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,800
所以
{\fs10}And so,{\r}

612
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,970
就剩下我一个人  挺孤单的
{\fs10}I'm about to be quite lonely.{\r}

613
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,930
好吧  我们的回答是不可以
{\fs10}Right. Well, I think we should probably say no.{\r}

614
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,140
可以啊  他笑起来挺可爱的
{\fs10}No, yes. But on the other hand, he's got a quite nice smile,{\r}

615
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,310
头发也挺搞笑
{\fs10}and sort of, you know, fun hair.{\r}

616
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
可以啊
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

617
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,480
好吧
{\fs10}All right.{\r}

618
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,490
不过你得保证
{\fs10}But you have to promise that{\r}

619
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,990
你不是以下的其中之一
{\fs10}you are not one of the following things.{\r}

626
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,500
你觉不觉得她的魅力来自于她的过去
{\fs10}Do you agree that the magic of her lies in her history?{\r}

627
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,300
看她早期打破常规的作品
{\fs10}That the informality of her early shots{\r}

628
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,430
与现如今的相比  你就知道
{\fs10}compared to this stuff so you just always know,{\r}

629
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,320
即便身穿高级时装
{\fs10}That despite the high fashion,{\r}

630
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,600
她依旧是那个在海滩上坦然全裸的不羁女孩
{\fs10}she's still just that cheeky normal naked girl on the beach?{\r}

631

说的太好了
{\fs10}Couldn't have put it better myself.{\r}

639
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,870
我看上去不像有男朋友吗
{\fs10}Do I not look like I'd have a boyfriend?{\r}

640
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,890
-我看上去像交不到男朋友吗  -不像
{\fs10}- Do I look like I'd never get a boyfriend? - No.{\r}

641
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,580
这是我听过最无礼的话
{\fs10}That's the rudest thing I've ever heard.{\r}

642
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,460
我不是这个意思  我只是没想到...
{\fs10}I didn't mean it like that. I just didn't expect...{\r}

643
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,710
是新交的男朋友吗
{\fs10}Is it quite a new boyfriend?{\r}

653
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,530
我觉得我们过后可以看场电影

660
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,360
我得教教你
{\fs10}I'm gonna have to teach you{\r}

{\fs10}what you can and can't say in front of people.{\r}

662
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,840

简直是个炼狱  幸好鲁伯特救了我
{\fs10}A living hell from which Rupert, thank God, rescued me.{\r}

670
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,570

{\fs10}And where was this terrible party?{\r}

671
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,780
就在我的破公寓里
{\fs10}My brothel of a flat.{\r}

672
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,080
那是在哪儿呢  重点就在这  不是吗
{\fs10}Which is where, though? That's the question, isn't it?{\r}

673
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,250
怎么  你是侦探吗
{\fs10}What are you, a detective?{\r}

674
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,770

{\fs10}No, sorry, I've just got a very visual imagination.{\r}

675
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,870

当然  很好  不过我还想知道
{\fs10}Absolutely, yes. Although I am wondering{\r}

680
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,050
你是什么时候到的  是早是晚  鲁伯特

老天
{\fs10}God.{\r}

683
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,970
我感觉有些不舒服
{\fs10}I actually feel a bit sick now.{\r}

684
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,390
可能是这些松饼  千万别吃蓝莓的
{\fs10}Just these muffins, I think. Never trust a blueberry.{\r}

685
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,400
好的  我马上回来
{\fs10}Okay, I'll be back in a tick.{\r}

{\fs10}You two are such a lovely couple.{\r}

687
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,320
有点怪
{\fs10}Bit weird.{\r}

我叫蒂姆

705
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,250
我知道这样很唐突  但是
{\fs10}I know this is forward but{\r}

706
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,050
你的表情告诉我
{\fs10}your face tells me that{\r}

707
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,420
你觉得这派对是个人间炼狱
{\fs10}you're finding this party to be a living hell.{\r}

708
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,960
所以我想问你  是不是愿意
{\fs10}So, I just wondered if you might come{\r}

709
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:55,380
和我一起出去吃点东西
{\fs10}and have a bite to eat with me instead?{\r}

710
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,340
就现在
{\fs10}Right now.{\r}

711

{\fs10}I always think the key thing with her is the history,{\r}

716
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,790
-没错  -她早期打破常规的作品
{\fs10}- Yes. - you know, the informality of her early shots{\r}

717
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,570
和高级时装摄影形成对比
{\fs10}compared to high fashion stuff{\r}

718
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,860
你会知道  她的内心从未改变  还是那个
{\fs10}so you always know that underneath she's still just the same{\r}

719
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,450
在海滩上坦然全裸的不羁女孩
{\fs10}cheeky normal girl naked on the beach.{\r}

就可以多吃几道开胃菜了
{\fs10}you know, more than one starter.{\r}

724
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,050
你的眼睛真美
{\fs10}I love your eyes.{\r}

725
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,930
你脸上的其他部分也是
{\fs10}And I love the rest of your face, too.{\r}

726
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,900
多吃几道开胃菜
{\fs10}More than one starter?{\r}

727
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,730
十道绝妙的开胃菜

729
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,070
不管什么派对  待上十分钟都够长的了
{\fs10}Ten minutes is long enough for any party, I think.{\r}

730
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,080
是啊
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

731
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,490
特别是这个
{\fs10}Especially that one.{\r}

732
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,160
晚上好啊
{\fs10}Evening, all.{\r}

733
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,660
天哪  真是个蠢蛋
{\fs10}God! What a dickhead.{\r}

734
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,750

00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,300
你是做什么的
{\fs10}So, what do you do?{\r}

736
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,930
我在出版社看书
{\fs10}I'm a reader at a publisher.{\r}

737
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,680
不是吧  你看书也能赚钱
{\fs10}No! You read for a living?{\r}

738
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,140
没错  我的工作就是看书
{\fs10}Yes, that's it. I read.{\r}

739
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,810
有这么好的事
{\fs10}That's so great.{\r}

740
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,060
就好像有人问你  "你靠什么过活"
{\fs10}It's like someone asking, "What do you do for a living?"{\r}

741
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,190
"我呼吸就好了  有人花钱让我呼吸"
{\fs10}"Well, I breathe. I'm a breather, I get paid for breathing."{\r}

742
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,300
-你怎么找到这工作的  -好了机灵鬼
{\fs10}- How did you get that job? - Okay, smart-ass,{\r}

743
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,320
你是做什么的
{\fs10}what do you do?{\r}

744
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,200
我是个律师
{\fs10}I am a lawyer.{\r}

745
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:43,780
差不多是吧
{\fs10}Sort of. Sort of.{\r}

746
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,530
真带感
{\fs10}That's sexy.{\r}

747
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,370
是吗
{\fs10}Is it?{\r}

748
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,870
我是这么觉得的
{\fs10}I mean, I think so.{\r}

749
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:52,880
穿着律师袍在法庭上拯救别人的生活
{\fs10}In a suit, in a court, saving people's lives.{\r}

750
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,040
是挺带感的
{\fs10}Kinda sexy.{\r}

751
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,420
我想也是  不过肯定没有看书带感
{\fs10}I guess it is. Although it's not as sexy as reading.{\r}

752
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,880
在办公室里  坐在一张椅子上看书
{\fs10}Sitting there in an office, in a little chair reading.{\r}

753
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,470
好了  打住  打住
{\fs10}Okay, stop. Stop.{\r}

754
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,220
没这么简单  听我说
{\fs10}Just wait right there, mister, because{\r}

755
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,890
交给我们出版社的书有很多
{\fs10}a lot of books get submitted to my publisher.{\r}

756
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,720
所以这是个很大的责任
{\fs10}So it's an immense responsibility.{\r}

757
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,470
肯定是
{\fs10}I bet it is.{\r}

758
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,560
那你正常阅读的时候
{\fs10}But when you do normal reading,{\r}

759
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,170
会不会被工作影响呢
{\fs10}is it ruined because it's your job?{\r}

760
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,360
就像妓女
{\fs10}You know, like prostitutes?{\r}

761
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,610
我总是担心  当她们不再干那一行
{\fs10}I always worry that when they stop being prostitutes{\r}

762
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,070
她们就不能享受做爱的感觉了
{\fs10}that they can't enjoy sex any more.{\r}

763
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,570
你总是担心这个吗
{\fs10}You always worry about that?{\r}

764
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,780
-不  有时候会担心  -好吧
{\fs10}- No, I sometimes worry about it. - Good. Okay.{\r}

765
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,190
总是担心这个的人
{\fs10}Because someone who always worried about that{\r}

766
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,930
-可不太让人放心  -你读报纸的时候
{\fs10}- would be a bit of a worry. - When you read a newspaper,{\r}

767
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,530
会不会想  "算了  这是工作"
{\fs10}do you think, "Forget this, it's work"?{\r}

768
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,820
你是不是见过很多妓女
{\fs10}Have you interviewed a lot of prostitutes?{\r}

769
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,980
你看菜单的时候  是不是也会想
{\fs10}When you read a menu, do you think,{\r}

770
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,520
"我才不看呢  除非你付我现金"
{\fs10}"No, I'm not reading this, unless you pay me hard cash."{\r}

771
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,020
你得和多少个妓女谈过
{\fs10}How many prostitutes will you need to talk to{\r}

772
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:39,020
才能解决这个问题呢
{\fs10}before this issue is solved?{\r}

773
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,010
你有没想过去东欧和泰国呢
{\fs10}Are you planning to head to Eastern Europe and Thailand?{\r}

774
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,940
陪我走到车那儿去  好吗
{\fs10}Would you like to walk me to my car?{\r}

775
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,430
-好啊  -好的
{\fs10}- Yes. - Okay.{\r}

776
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,570
当然好
{\fs10}Why not?{\r}

777
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,740
这主意不错
{\fs10}Sounds like a good idea.{\r}

778
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,700
那你呢
{\fs10}What about you?{\r}

779
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,870
我有三个哥哥
{\fs10}Yeah, I have three older brothers.{\r}

780
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,540
-天哪  -是啊
{\fs10}- God. - Yeah.{\r}

781
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,210
他们在哪
{\fs10}Where are they?{\r}

782
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,380
在你背后
{\fs10}Behind you.{\r}

783
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,800
你是没地方停车吗
{\fs10}Did you have trouble parking?{\r}

784
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,440
什么
{\fs10}Pardon?{\r}

785
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,980
停在这么远的地方
{\fs10}It's just such a long way to your car.{\r}

786
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,050
其实  我的车就停在我家外面
{\fs10}Well, my car's actually parked outside my house.{\r}

787
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,500
我是搭便车去的派对
{\fs10}I got a lift to the party.{\r}

788
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,480
好吧
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

789
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,410
很好  太好了
{\fs10}That's good. That's perfect.{\r}

790
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,820
是吗
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

791
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,620
到了
{\fs10}And here we are.{\r}

792
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,670
我的天
{\fs10}My God.{\r}

793
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,130
车子  家  家  车子
{\fs10}Car, house. House, car.{\r}

794
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,630
原来如此
{\fs10}It makes perfect sense.{\r}

795
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,590
很合逻辑
{\fs10}It's very logical.{\r}

796
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:28,950
老天爷
{\fs10}Christ.{\r}

797
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:36,540
钥匙
{\fs10}Keys!{\r}

798
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,970
我去房间换上新睡衣
{\fs10}I'm gonna go into the bedroom and put on my new pyjamas.{\r}

799
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,350
好的
{\fs10}Right.{\r}

800
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,690
一分钟后  你可以进来帮我脱掉
{\fs10}And then in a minute you can come in and take them off.{\r}

801
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,400
如果你愿意的话
{\fs10}If you want to.{\r}

802
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,080
一分钟

抱歉
{\fs10}Sorry.{\r}

805
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,050
没关系
{\fs10}That's okay.{\r}

806
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,620
这是前扣式的
{\fs10}It's a front opener.{\r}

807
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,330
这是什么
{\fs10}It's a what?{\r}

808
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,120
扣子在前面
{\fs10}It opens from the front.{\r}

809
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,420
原来如此
{\fs10}Yeah, no, yeah, of course.{\r}

810
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,130
-谢了  -没事
{\fs10}- Thanks. - Sure.{\r}

811
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,300
真棒
{\fs10}Ooh! Well done.{\r}

812
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,980
下次肯定会更好
{\fs10}I'm sure it'll be better next time.{\r}

813
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,980
我觉得已经很好了
{\fs10}I thought it was pretty lovely.{\r}

814
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,150
是啊  确实很好
{\fs10}Right, no, it was really lovely.{\r}

815
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:35,160
你等我一下好吗
{\fs10}In fact, can you just give me one minute?{\r}

816
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,620
好的
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

817
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,670
真危险
{\fs10}Dangerous.{\r}

818
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:55,090
你还真懂内衣啊
{\fs10}You really know your bras.{\r}

819
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,050
希望如此
{\fs10}I like to think so.{\r}

820
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,690
真不错  有些人第一次搞得一团糟
{\fs10}Well done. Some people make a real mess of it the first time.{\r}

821
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,270
菜鸟吧
{\fs10}Amateurs.{\r}

822
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,690
等我一下好吗
{\fs10}Could you give me one second?{\r}

823
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,780
当然
{\fs10}Sure.{\r}

824
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,200
我等不及了
{\fs10}I couldn't wait.{\r}

825
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,450
我的老天
{\fs10}My goodness.{\r}

826
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,530
我这辈子最好的一夜
{\fs10}Best night of my entire life.{\r}

827
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,710
接下来  我猜我要
{\fs10}And now I've got a suspicion{\r}

828
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,630
睡上这辈子最好的一觉了
{\fs10}I'm gonna have the best sleep of my entire life.{\r}

829
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,470
我的完美男人  一次就够了吗
{\fs10}So once is enough for my perfect guy?{\r}

830
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,970
这么说可不太公平
{\fs10}I'm not sure that's entirely fair.{\r}

831
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,980
-迟到了  -没有
{\fs10}- We're late. - No, we're not.{\r}

832
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:55,030
没事的  现在才...天哪
{\fs10}It'll be fine. It's only... My God.{\r}

833
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,480

我会需要你多久

00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,760
甚至可以更长久
{\fs10}And longer if I may{\r}

851
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,830
我有个坏消息
{\fs10}Okay. I have some bad news.{\r}

852
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,620
-你要死了吗  -不  没那么糟
{\fs10}- You're dying? - No, not that bad.{\r}

853
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,500
-我要死了  -不是
{\fs10}- I'm dying? - No.{\r}

854
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,880
我父母进城来了
{\fs10}My parents are in town.{\r}

855
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,170
他们要过来  就快到了
{\fs10}They're visiting and they're coming around.{\r}

856
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,210
天哪  父母  美国的父母吗
{\fs10}God. Parents? American parents?{\r}

857
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,010
-什么时候  -现在
{\fs10}- When? - Now.{\r}

858
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,130
他们事先和我说了  我没告诉你
{\fs10}They told me and I didn't tell you{\r}

859
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:40,580
我以为他们会临时取消
{\fs10}and I thought they'd cancel{\r}

860
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,270
因为他们经常这样  但这次没有
{\fs10}because they normally do and they didn't.{\r}

861
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,900
-就这会儿吗  -就这会儿
{\fs10}- Now now? - Now now.{\r}

862
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,590
所以你最好穿条裤子
{\fs10}So you should probably put on some pants.{\r}

863
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,890
老天  好  好
{\fs10}God. Okay, okay.{\r}

{\fs10}I'm sorry, I'm sorry.{\r}

865
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,190
他们知道我这个人吗
{\fs10}Do they know I exist?{\r}

866
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,860
知道  我稍微提过
{\fs10}Yeah. I've mentioned something like you,{\r}

867
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,480
但没说得很具体
{\fs10}but nothing very specific.{\r}

868
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,360
对了  他们比较保守  还是换条裤子吧
{\fs10}Yeah, they're quite conservative, so maybe not those pants.{\r}

869
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,530
好的  好的
{\fs10}Okay. Yeah.{\r}

870
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,700
天哪  好吧
{\fs10}God. Okay.{\r}

871
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:13,580
你能先拖住他们吗  拖一会儿
{\fs10}Could you just stall them. Stall them.{\r}

872
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,670
上来吧
{\fs10}Come on up.{\r}

873
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,720
-什么  -抱歉了  他们不喜欢等
{\fs10}- What? - I'm sorry, they don't like waiting.{\r}

874
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,550
-好吧  -我要说我住这儿吗
{\fs10}- Okay. - Do I live here?{\r}

875
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,340
绝对不行
{\fs10}Definitely not.{\r}

876
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,470
那能说我们做爱吗
{\fs10}Are we having sex?{\r}

877
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,220
可以  但别说口交
{\fs10}Yeah. But not oral.{\r}

878
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:29,720
我没打算说这个
{\fs10}I wasn't gonna mention oral.{\r}

879
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,090
很好  别说
{\fs10}Okay, good, don't.{\r}

880
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,600
你为什么觉得会说到这个
{\fs10}How did you think that was gonna come up?{\r}

881
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,130
能帮我弄一下这个吗
{\fs10}Could you help me with this, please?{\r}

882
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:37,400
不知道  如果说到了  就一口否认
{\fs10}I don't know. If it does, just deny it completely.{\r}

883
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,570
谁会问到这个  你爸爸吗
{\fs10}Who's gonna bring it up? Your dad?{\r}

884
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,400
"蒂姆  最近跟我女儿口交了吗"
{\fs10}"Tim, had any cunnilingus with my daughter recently?"{\r}

885
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,780
这可不好说
{\fs10}Well, you never know.{\r}

886
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,200
好吧
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

887
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,830
-好  准备好了吗  -好了
{\fs10}- Okay. Ready? - Yeah.{\r}

888
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
-他们到了  -到了
{\fs10}- They're there. - They are, yeah.{\r}

889
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,910
-我就在你背后  -好的  好的
{\fs10}- Yeah, right behind you. - Okay. Right, okay.{\r}

890
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,090
-爸爸  -好啊  宝贝
{\fs10}- Dad! - Hello, sweet.{\r}

891
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,380
-妈妈  -好啊  亲爱的
{\fs10}- Mom. - Hi, honey.{\r}

892
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,920
这是蒂姆
{\fs10}This is Tim.{\r}

893
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,130
先生  太太  你们好
{\fs10}Hello, sir. Ma'am.{\r}

894
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,600
我们要不要等你朋友走了再来  还是...
{\fs10}Should we come back when you haven't got any company, or...{\r}

895
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,020
那不太可能
{\fs10}Well, that would be quite difficult{\r}

896
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,440
因为蒂姆就住在这儿
{\fs10}because Tim actually lives here.{\r}

897
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,270
是吗  和你一起住
{\fs10}Really? With you?{\r}

898
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:22,280
是的  但是没有口交  我保证
{\fs10}Yes. Yeah, but no oral sex, I promise you.{\r}

899
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,610
你说什么
{\fs10}I beg your pardon?{\r}

900
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,070
失陪一下
{\fs10}Excuse me.{\r}

901
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:33,120
蒂姆  说说你是哪里人  哪个地方的
{\fs10}So, Tim, tell us where are you from, which part of the country?{\r}

902
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,330
他是康沃尔的  那儿很漂亮
{\fs10}He's from Cornwall. Yeah, it's really pretty.{\r}

903
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,130
就是西南端鞋子形状的那块地方
{\fs10}It's that little bit right at the end, sort of looks like a shoe.{\r}

904
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,260
你是个律师  对吗
{\fs10}And you're a lawyer, is that right?{\r}

905
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,260
是的  没错  他从没输过
{\fs10}Yep, that's right. And he never loses.{\r}

906
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,640
有时候你以为他肯定赢不了了
{\fs10}You don't think he's gonna win,{\r}

907
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,640
但他总能想出个妙招
{\fs10}then he just pulls something out of the bag and,{\r}

908
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,930
然后就赢了
{\fs10}what do you know, he wins again.{\r}

909
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:53,310
你会自己回答问题吗
{\fs10}Do you ever answer any of your own questions?{\r}

910
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,850
-我...-他会的  他一般都自己回答
{\fs10}- I... - Yes, he does. Usually he does,{\r}

911
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,220
但今天不行  因为我一直说个不停
{\fs10}but not today because I'm doing all the talking{\r}

912
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,960
因为我很紧张
{\fs10}because I'm really nervous{\r}

913
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,990
我太喜欢他了  我希望你们也能喜欢他
{\fs10}and I kinda love him and I just... I want you to, too.{\r}

914
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,660
宝贝
{\fs10}Honey.{\r}

915
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,450
抱歉  蒂姆  你自己来吧
{\fs10}Sorry. Tim. Over to you.{\r}

916
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:11,950
说吧
{\fs10}Shoot.{\r}

917
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,190
-我想我爸爸...-我再说一句好吗
{\fs10}- Yeah, I think my dad... - Can I just say one more thing?{\r}

918
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:15,390
好
{\fs10}Yep.{\r}

919
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,540
谢天谢地  终于结束了
{\fs10}Thank God that's over.{\r}

920
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:22,130
我拿到两张国家剧院的票  明天的
{\fs10}I got given two tickets for the National Theatre tomorrow.{\r}

921
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,250
一起去吗
{\fs10}Do you wanna come?{\r}

922
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,340
不去了  我要睡一整天
{\fs10}No, so not. I'm just gonna sleep all day.{\r}

923
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,350
我不明白了  去剧院对睡觉有影响吗
{\fs10}I don't see why going to the theatre should get in the way of that.{\r}

924
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,680
我最好的几次睡眠
{\fs10}Many of the best sleeps of my life{\r}

925
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,850
都是在皇家莎士比亚剧院
{\fs10}have happened in the Royal Shakespeare Company.{\r}

926
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,520
不了  你带别人一起去吧
{\fs10}No, you take someone else.{\r}

927
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,520
我喜欢窝床上  不喜欢剧院
{\fs10}I really like bed and I really hate theatre.{\r}

928
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,360
好吧
{\fs10}Quite right.{\r}

929
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:48,150
哪个可怜鬼会周六晚上没有活动
{\fs10}But what kind of sad act is gonna be free on a Saturday night{\r}

930
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,780
还随叫随到
{\fs10}with no day's notice?{\r}

931
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,030
太棒了
{\fs10}Bravo.{\r}

932
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,210
-天哪  是夏洛特  -谁
{\fs10}- My God. It's Charlotte. - Who?{\r}

933
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,540
-我的初恋  -在哪
{\fs10}- It was my first love. - Where?{\r}

934
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,670
那边  出口标志下面
{\fs10}There. Under the "Exit" sign.{\r}

935
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,420
-那个老女人吗  -不  不是那个老女人
{\fs10}- The old woman? - No, not the old woman.{\r}

936
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,760
那个金发美女
{\fs10}The astonishing blonde.{\r}

937
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,510
-黑头发的吗  -不是  金发的
{\fs10}- The one with the dark hair? - No, blonde.{\r}

938
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,220
金发就是金色的头发  听不明白吗
{\fs10}Blonde means blonde hair, doesn't it?{\r}

939
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,930
在台下
{\fs10}Off the stage.{\r}

940
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,600
好  你待在这别动  说真的  待着
{\fs10}Okay, you stay there. I mean it, stay!{\r}

941
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,030
夏洛特
{\fs10}Charlotte.{\r}

942
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,070
天哪  蒂姆
{\fs10}My God. Tim.{\r}

943
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,120
见到你真好
{\fs10}How fabulous to see you.{\r}

944
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,370
我...这是我的女朋友  蒂娜
{\fs10}Wow. I... This is my girlfriend Tina.{\r}

945
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,750
不是吧
{\fs10}No.{\r}

946
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,040
太棒了  你好  蒂娜
{\fs10}That is so brilliant. Well, hello, Tina.{\r}

947
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,750
什么太棒了
{\fs10}Why is it brilliant?{\r}

948
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,720
生命里总会有一些时刻
{\fs10}Well, you know, there are certain moments in your life{\r}

949
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,030
会留下永久的创伤
{\fs10}that scar you for life.{\r}

950
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:52,060
夏洛特对我的拒绝  就是这样
{\fs10}Charlotte's rejection of me was one of those moments,{\r}

951
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:54,750
不过现在我知道她有"女朋友"了
{\fs10}but now I know she's got a "girlfriend", well,{\r}

952
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,320
这就让我松了一大口气了
{\fs10}that's just a huge burden suddenly lifted off my mind.{\r}

953
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:00,110
我可以重新做个自信的异性恋了
{\fs10}I can be a confident heterosexual all over again.{\r}

954
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,560
不是那种女朋友
{\fs10}Not that kind of girlfriend.{\r}

955
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,230
什么
{\fs10}What?{\r}

956
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,610
你以为我是同性恋吗
{\fs10}You think I'm gay?{\r}

957
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,740
不是
{\fs10}No.{\r}

958
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,890
不  当然不是
{\fs10}No, of course not.{\r}

959
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:15,910
不  应该是女性朋友
{\fs10}No. It's girl friend.{\r}

960
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,910
是的  不是
{\fs10}Yes. No. Wow.{\r}

961
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,460
女性的朋友  就是这样
{\fs10}Yeah, friend who is a girl, which you so clearly are.{\r}

962
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:25,420
我得去找一下我的男朋友  是个男的...
{\fs10}I'm just gonna go and get my boyfriend, who is a boy...{\r}

963
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,760
我的天啊  蒂姆
{\fs10}My God. Tim.{\r}

964
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,100
见到你真好  看看你
{\fs10}How lovely to see you. Look at you. Wow.{\r}

965
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,890
这是我的女朋友  蒂娜
{\fs10}This is my girlfriend Tina.{\r}

966
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,250
你好  蒂娜
{\fs10}Hello, Tina.{\r}

967
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,150
不过  你最好注意下用词
{\fs10}Although you should be a little careful with that, by the way.{\r}

968
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:47,320
还是会有很多守旧的人
{\fs10}There are still quite a lot of us old fashioned types about{\r}

969
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,650
会把"女朋友"理解成"同性恋"
{\fs10}who interpret "girlfriend" as meaning "gay".{\r}

970
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,510
如果你说蒂娜是你女朋友
{\fs10}So if you say that Tina's your girlfriend,{\r}

971
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,040
别人就会以为你们是"同性恋"
{\fs10}people will assume that you're "gay".{\r}

972
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:55,450
我就是"同性恋"
{\fs10}I am "gay".{\r}

973
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,660
是吗
{\fs10}Are you?{\r}

974
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:59,070
你有意见吗
{\fs10}Do you have a problem with that?{\r}

975
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:02,710
不  不是  我可喜欢了
{\fs10}No, I don't. I love that stuff.{\r}

976
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,670
我去一下...
{\fs10}I'm just gonna...{\r}

977
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,510
我看见三年前那个夏天让我心碎的女孩了
{\fs10}I've just seen the girl who broke my heart three summers ago.{\r}

978
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,510
去打个招呼吧
{\fs10}Let's go say hello.{\r}

979
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,510
不  还是别找麻烦了  走吧
{\fs10}No. Best let sleeping dogs lie. Come on.{\r}

980
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,050
今晚真是妙极了  我很喜欢这里
{\fs10}Best night of my life. I always love this area.{\r}

981
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,520
很热闹  还有那些色彩艳丽的画
{\fs10}It's so bustling and I mean those pictures, full of colour.{\r}

982
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,720
每次来这里都很开心
{\fs10}Just makes me so happy when I'm round here,{\r}

983
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,770
-这么多色彩  -蒂姆
{\fs10}- all the colour... - Tim.{\r}

984
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,190
夏洛特
{\fs10}Charlotte!{\r}

985
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,690
蒂姆  见到你真好
{\fs10}Tim, how lovely to see you.{\r}

986
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,310
真是个惊喜啊
{\fs10}What a surprise.{\r}

987
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,360
抱歉  这是我的女朋友  蒂娜

{\fs10}She's okay. She's not finding London totally easy actually.{\r}

998
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,380

{\fs10}You knew there was always something there.{\r}

1001
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:01,060
不好意思  你是

{\fs10}- Roger. - No, it's not.{\r}

1005
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,350
不是罗杰  我叫罗利
{\fs10}No, it's not. it's Rory.{\r}

1006
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,360
-很高兴认识你  罗利  -嗯

天哪  她真美
{\fs10}God, she is beautiful.{\r}

1012
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:23,580
她太美了  要是你跟她上床你会死的
{\fs10}She's so beautiful, if you had sex with her, you'd die. You'd just die.{\r}

1013
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,080
脱她的衣服  看她的胸眼睛都会爆炸
{\fs10}You'd open her shirt, see her breasts and your eyes would explode.{\r}

1014
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,490
你就得瞎着跟她做爱  然后就死了
{\fs10}You'd have to have sex with her blind. And then you'd die.{\r}

1015
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,130
注意到了吗  她没给我她的号码
{\fs10}You notice she didn't give me her number...{\r}

1016
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:36,130
我让蒂娜自己去吃饭了  你饿吗
{\fs10}I told Tina to go have dinner on her own. Are you hungry?{\r}

1017
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,760
-饿  当然饿  -太好了

知道吗
{\fs10}You know,{\r}

1025
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:07,620
我开始有点觉得我们浪费了那个暑假
{\fs10}I'm starting to think we slightly wasted that summer holiday.{\r}

1026
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,170
要是我们能穿越回去
{\fs10}If we could travel back in time,{\r}

1027
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:13,840
也许我不会拒绝
{\fs10}maybe I wouldn't have said no.{\r}

1028
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,760
我
{\fs10}I'm...{\r}

1029
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,630
我就住在拐角
{\fs10}I'm just staying round the corner.{\r}

1030
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,300
能送我上楼吗
{\fs10}Can you walk me home?{\r}

1031

我们到了
{\fs10}Well, here we are.{\r}

1034
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,990
里面
{\fs10}It's a lot nicer{\r}

1035
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,580
更好
{\fs10}inside.{\r}

1036
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,830
我觉得也是
{\fs10}I'm sure it is.{\r}

1037
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,010
那...那么
{\fs10}So... So...{\r}

醒醒  来聊聊天
{\fs10}Wake up. Come and have a chat.{\r}

1054
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,760
干什么
{\fs10}Why?{\r}

1055
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:30,350
我有件很重要的事要问你
{\fs10}I've got something important to ask you.{\r}

1056
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,270

{\fs10}Can't it wait till morning?{\r}

1057
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,230
不行

01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:41,190
可是我好舒服
{\fs10}But I'm so comfy.{\r}

1059
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:44,360

为什么有音乐
{\fs10}Why is there music on?{\r}

1062
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:53,120
跟我要问你的事有关
{\fs10}It's got something to do with what I want to ask you.{\r}

1063
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:56,620

跪着
{\fs10}On his knees.{\r}

1068
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:12,260
你看表演看太无聊了  就决定
{\fs10}Were you so bored in the play you decided{\r}

1069
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:15,140
结束后来跟我求婚吗
{\fs10}to ask me to marry you afterwards?{\r}

1070
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,110
差不多
{\fs10}Something like that.{\r}

1071
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,400
对  完全正确
{\fs10}Yeah. Exactly that.{\r}

1072
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,110
说真的
{\fs10}In fact,{\r}

你愿意嫁给我吗

有想过这个问题的答案吗
{\fs10}Any thoughts on the answer?{\r}

1075
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:44,610

都有可能
{\fs10}they're all possible.{\r}

还要谢谢你没有搞得很戏剧性
{\fs10}And thank you for not going for one of those melodramatic proposals{\r}

1081
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,660
一大群人围着的那种
{\fs10}with lots of people around.{\r}

1082
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,120
我讨厌有别人
{\fs10}I hate other people.{\r}

1083
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:13,830
我也是

01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,040
好的  好主意

{\fs10}Thanks, guys. Sorry, she's a bit tired.{\r}

1088
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,810
但是非常感谢  你们能走吗
{\fs10}But we really appreciate it. Can you go?{\r}

1089
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,570
太美了
{\fs10}That's so beautiful.{\r}

1090
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,320
可是我觉得我们不能住一个房间
{\fs10}I don't think we'll be staying in the same room, somehow.{\r}

1091
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:54,660
真的吗
{\fs10}Really?{\r}

1092
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:57,750
要是他们让你喝茶  就拒绝
{\fs10}If they offer you tea, just say no.{\r}

1093
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,420
妈妈  这是玛丽
{\fs10}Mum, this is Mary.{\r}

1094
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,880
玛丽
{\fs10}Mary!{\r}

1095
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,590
我的天哪  你真漂亮
{\fs10}Good Lord, you're pretty.{\r}

1096
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,340
不  我就是
{\fs10}No, it's just{\r}

1097
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,260
妆画得比较浓
{\fs10}I've got a lot of mascara and lipstick on.{\r}

1098
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,760
我看看
{\fs10}Let's have a look.{\r}

是哦  很好
{\fs10}Yes. Good.{\r}

1100
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:17,350
女孩太漂亮不好
{\fs10}It's very bad for a girl to be too pretty.{\r}

1101
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:21,600
太漂亮就没有幽默感  或者没特色
{\fs10}It stops her developing a sense of humour. Or a personality.{\r}

1102
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,350
喝茶吗
{\fs10}Tea?{\r}

非常愿意
{\fs10}I'd love a cup of tea.{\r}

1104
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,020
天哪  一整天的时间都要没了
{\fs10}Christ, that's the whole day gone.{\r}

1105
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,390
她是位很特别的客人
{\fs10}She's a very special guest.{\r}

1106
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,780
只要茶  不要饼干
{\fs10}Cup without the crack.{\r}

1107
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,150
打水漂
{\fs10}Skipping stones.{\r}

1108
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,950
他们从他这么高的时候就一直玩这个
{\fs10}They've been doing this since he was about this high.{\r}

1109
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,740
你有什么缺点  就是小弱点
{\fs10}And what are your faults? I mean, little weaknesses.{\r}

1110
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,710
我
{\fs10}I...{\r}

1111
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,550

1201
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:53,270

01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,880
天哪
{\fs10}My God!{\r}

1236
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,160
我是罗利
{\fs10}I'm Rory.{\r}

1237
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:25,710
蒂姆让我当他的伴郎的时候  我吓坏了
{\fs10}When Tim asked me to be his Best Man, I was terrified.{\r}

1238
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,550
所以我想最好是去找一本
{\fs10}So I thought best thing is to find{\r}

1239
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:31,380
关于演讲的书  这本就是
{\fs10}a book about speeches. And here it is.{\r}

1240
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,930
书上说想想有趣的轶事
{\fs10}And it says think of really funny anecdotes.{\r}

1241
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:41,810
工作时候  有件非常好笑的事
{\fs10}And there is a very hilarious story, actually from work.{\r}

1242
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,480
这个笑话基于一个挺复杂的案子
{\fs10}It was quite a complicated case based on an issue of{\r}

1243
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,440
有关离婚后

1244
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,110

{\fs10}post-divorce properties and, um...{\r}

1245
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,070
我解释一下背景  被告...
{\fs10}Let me just explain the context. The Defendant...{\r}

1246
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:00,120
蒂姆让我做伴郎演讲时
{\fs10}When Tim asked me to do his Best Man speech,{\r}

1247
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,500
我当即的反应是
{\fs10}my immediate reaction was,{\r}

1248
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,540
你要付我多少钱  小混球
{\fs10}"How much are you gonna pay me, you little shit?{\r}

1249
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,920
我写的东西可得花钱买
{\fs10}"I don't write for free, you know."{\r}

1250
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,130
这些是那时他有机可趁的姑娘们
{\fs10}These were the girls available to him at that time.{\r}

1251
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,510
姑娘们好  而这是他跟她们的距离
{\fs10}"Hello, girls." And this is how far he got with each of them.{\r}

1252
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:16,720
我来解释编号的含义  5代表口交
{\fs10}Let me explain the code. 5, blow job.{\r}

1253
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,040
8代表完全深入...
{\fs10}8, full penetrative...{\r}

1254
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,640
那么我们敬一杯
{\fs10}And so a toast{\r}

1255
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,730
给这间屋子发型最糟糕
{\fs10}to the man with the worst haircut{\r}

1256
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,810
但是人最好的新郎
{\fs10}but the best bride in the room.{\r}

1257
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,030
女士们先生们  蒂姆和玛丽
{\fs10}Ladies and gentlemen, Tim and Mary.{\r}

1258
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:32,150
蒂姆和玛丽
{\fs10}Tim and Mary.{\r}

1259
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,030
是我们
{\fs10}That's us.{\r}

1260
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,950
我要是说了"我爱你"就好了
{\fs10}I wish I'd said "I love you".{\r}

1261
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,740
你说了  爸爸
{\fs10}You did, Dad.{\r}

1262
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,410
话里的意思就是
{\fs10}It was implied.{\r}

1263
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:44,620
我觉得婚礼上搞"话中话"不大好
{\fs10}I'm not sure "implied" is good enough for a wedding day, are you?{\r}

1264
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,920
不  别那么做  这样就好
{\fs10}No, don't do it, it's fine.{\r}

1265
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,880
现在这样我就很高兴  真的不用
{\fs10}I'm so happy with it as it was. You really don't have to.{\r}

1266
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,300
我要按我想的做  小伙子
{\fs10}I'll do what I wanna do, young man.{\r}

1267
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:55,680
我能先离开一下吗
{\fs10}Will you excuse me for just one moment?{\r}

1268
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,510
待会儿我会给你们讲述
{\fs10}Later on I may tell you about{\r}

1269
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,020
蒂姆作为男人以及乒乓球选手的许多失败故事
{\fs10}Tim's many failings as a man and as a table tennis player.{\r}

1270
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,140
但是
{\fs10}But,{\r}

1271
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,770
重要的是先说一件大事
{\fs10}important first to say the one{\r}

1272
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:13,280
我一生中
{\fs10}big thing, I've only loved{\r}

1273
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,740
只爱过三个男人
{\fs10}three men in my life.{\r}

1274
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,240
我爸爸是个冷酷的讨厌鬼
{\fs10}My dad was a frosty bugger so that{\r}

1275
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:21,410
所以第一位是亲爱的德斯蒙德叔叔
{\fs10}only leaves dear Uncle Desmond,{\r}

1276
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,710
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}美国布鲁斯吉他手和歌曲作者  2003滚石杂志排名第三吉他手
最伟大的布鲁斯音乐家之一  外号"布鲁斯之王"

1277
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,170
第二位当然是B·B·金
{\fs10}B.B. King, obviously,{\r}

1278
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,710
还有就是这个小伙子
{\fs10}and this young man here.{\r}

1279
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,750
我只给将结婚的人一条建议
{\fs10}I'd only give one piece of advice to anyone marrying.{\r}

1280
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:36,300
我们最终都差不多
{\fs10}We're all quite similar in the end.{\r}

1281
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:40,050
我们年华老去  境况大同小异
{\fs10}We all get old and tell the same tales too many times.{\r}

1282
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,470
但是试着跟一个
{\fs10}But try and marry someone{\r}

1283
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:45,890
善良的人结合
{\fs10}kind.{\r}

1284
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,980
而这是一位有着好心肠的
{\fs10}And this is a kind man{\r}

1285
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,400
善良男人
{\fs10}with a good heart.{\r}

1286
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:54,650
我一生中没有很多
{\fs10}I'm not particularly proud{\r}

1287
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:58,410
特别自豪的事  但是作为他的父亲
{\fs10}of many things in my life, but I am very proud{\r}

1288
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:02,080
我十分自豪
{\fs10}to be the father of my son.{\r}

1289
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:09,920
很抱歉打断你  但能跟你要个签名吗
{\fs10}I'm so sorry to disturb you, but I wonder if I could have your autograph.{\r}

1290
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,040
不  不行
{\fs10}No. No.{\r}

1291
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:13,910
我在婚礼上呢  老天啊
{\fs10}I'm at a wedding, for God's sake.{\r}

1292
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,300
我在这里庆祝真爱  而不是
{\fs10}I'm here to celebrate true love not{\r}

1293
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:18,800
在一张纸上随便签个名
{\fs10}scribble my illegible signature on stupid{\r}

1294
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:21,300
好让你放到网上拍卖
{\fs10}bits of paper that you can flog on eBay{\r}

1295
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:24,600
换点钱买个不这么丑的帽子戴
{\fs10}so that at the next wedding you can wear a less hideous hat.{\r}

1296
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,100
你好像见过我的梅姑姑了
{\fs10}I see you've met my Aunt May.{\r}

1297
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:30,980
神啊  大家要是都戴着姓名牌就好了
{\fs10}God. People should wear name tags.{\r}

1298
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,190
下一个就是你了  琪凯
{\fs10}You next, Kittle Kattle.{\r}

1299
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,440
我也不知道  D舅舅
{\fs10}I don't know, Uncle D.{\r}

1300
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,160
男生对我都不怎么好
{\fs10}Boys aren't very nice.{\r}

1301
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,280
真的吗  亲爱的
{\fs10}Aren't they, darling?{\r}

1302
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,660
据我所知是这样的
{\fs10}Not in my experience.{\r}

1303
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:48,790
他们永远都是随随便便的
{\fs10}They're always taking liberties,{\r}

1304
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,000
不懂得报答别人
{\fs10}not giving much back in return.{\r}

1305
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,380
-好吃  -是吗
{\fs10}- It's yummy. - Yeah?{\r}

1306
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,630
我喜欢你说好吃的样子
{\fs10}I like the way you say 'yummy'.{\r}

1307
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:09,640
你会不会希望我们当初挑了个晴朗的日子
{\fs10}Do you wish we'd picked another less wet day?{\r}

1308
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,730
不会
{\fs10}No.{\r}

1309
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:13,690
根本不会
{\fs10}Not for the world.{\r}

1310
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:21,200
这就开始了
{\fs10}And so it begins.{\r}

1311
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,570
丰富多彩的每日生活
{\fs10}Lots and lots of types of days.{\r}

1312
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:26,490
多有趣
{\fs10}Fun!{\r}

1313
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
叫波丝吧
{\fs10}Posy.{\r}

1314
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:37,340
听你的
{\fs10}Posy she is.{\r}

1315
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,170
世界上最漂亮的小姑娘
{\fs10}The most beautiful girl in the world.{\r}

1316
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:47,560
想让爸爸抱了吧  我懂你的
{\fs10}You want your daddy. Yes, I know.{\r}

1317
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:51,850
好嘞
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

1318
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,280
没人能帮你做准备
{\fs10}No one can ever prepare you for{\r}

1319
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,530
迎接即将到来的婴儿
{\fs10}what happens when you have a child.{\r}

1320
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:00,280
当看到怀中的小孩子
{\fs10}When you see the baby in your arms{\r}

1321
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,990
你就会明白现在这就是你的责任了
{\fs10}and you know that it's your job now.{\r}

1322
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:07,740
你无法对未知的爱与恐惧做好心理准备
{\fs10}No one can prepare you for the love and the fear.{\r}

1323
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:11,330
她真可爱
{\fs10}She's lovely.{\r}

1324
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,370
你刚出生时可丑了
{\fs10}You were such an ugly baby.{\r}

1325
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,380
不像小孩  像黑猩猩
{\fs10}More chimpanzee than child.{\r}

1326
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,550
我还记得第一次见到你的时候
{\fs10}I remember the first time I saw you,{\r}

1327
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:21,020
我很感谢上帝我们离伦敦动物园不远
{\fs10}I thanked God we were in{\r}

1328
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:21,550
开车就到
{\fs10}driving distance of London Zoo.{\r}

1329
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,260
来来  把这个小家伙抱过来
{\fs10}Come on, hand over the little bugger,{\r}

1330
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:25,840
看看她会不会扭来扭去
{\fs10}let's see if she bounces.{\r}

1331
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:27,720
当然啦  她肯定会扭
{\fs10}Yeah, she definitely will bounce.{\r}

1332
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,010
看啊
{\fs10}Look.{\r}

1333
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,270
她什么都做得到
{\fs10}She can do anything.{\r}

1334
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,350
看啊  你好啊
{\fs10}Look. Hello.{\r}

1335
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,020
小宝贝
{\fs10}Sweetheart.{\r}

1336
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:38,770
你无法预料自己所爱的人们
{\fs10}No one can prepare you for the love{\r}

1337
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,690
会感受到什么样的爱
{\fs10}people you love can feel for them.{\r}

1338
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,320
而且也没法预料
{\fs10}And nothing can prepare you for{\r}

1339
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,370
那些没生小孩的朋友们的冷漠
{\fs10}the indifference of friends who don't have babies.{\r}

1340
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:48,240
想让杰叔叔抱抱吗
{\fs10}Do you wanna go to Uncle Jay?{\r}

1341
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:50,240
不用了  谢谢  我这样很好
{\fs10}No, thanks, it's fine. It's great.{\r}

1342
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:52,790
你还会惊讶这么快就得
{\fs10}And it's a shock how quickly you have to move{\r}

1343
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:55,710
搬到一个费用不菲的的新家
{\fs10}to a new place you completely can't afford.{\r}

1344
01:17:56,290 --> 01:17:57,750
瞧这是什么
{\fs10}Look what we found.{\r}

1345
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,290
快看它是谁
{\fs10}Look who it is!{\r}

1346
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:00,960
亲爱的
{\fs10}Honey!{\r}

1347
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:02,210
抱歉
{\fs10}Sorry.{\r}

1348
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:08,600
突然之间  时空旅行好似毫无必要
{\fs10}Suddenly, time travel seems almost unnecessary,{\r}

1349
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,760
因为生活中的其他部分都如此令人振奋
{\fs10}because every detail of life is so delightful.{\r}

1350
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:19,730
它叫什么名字
{\fs10}What's his name?{\r}

1351
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,940
霍勒斯  我猜的
{\fs10}Horace, I think.{\r}

1352
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,230
那肯定就叫这个
{\fs10}Of course it is.{\r}

1353
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,530
我听说  作为教父唯一的重点就是
{\fs10}Only one important thing for a godfather, I'm told,{\r}

1354
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:26,950
永远不要给小孩买比它身体还小的礼物
{\fs10}never bring a present smaller than the child.{\r}

1355
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,450
闭嘴吧  你这个自以为是的混蛋
{\fs10}Shut up, you smug bastard.{\r}

1356
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,450
别担心了  我什么东西都没带
{\fs10}Don't worry, I didn't bring anything at all.{\r}

1357
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,500
她不会注意到的  脑子还没发育呢
{\fs10}She'll never know. Hasn't got a brain yet.{\r}

1358
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,620
没想到在这里能见到你  哈利
{\fs10}I didn't expect to see you here, Harry.{\r}

1359
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:37,790
儿童聚会好像不是你的风格
{\fs10}Children's party's not exactly your style.{\r}

1360
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,600
没错  玛丽  我被骗了
{\fs10}No, Mary, I was tricked.{\r}

1361
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,130
他们跟我说有免费酒喝的
{\fs10}I was told there would be free booze.{\r}

1362
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,130
我讨厌小孩子  你知道的
{\fs10}I hate kids, as you know.{\r}

1363
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,930
话说奇巧去哪了
{\fs10}Where's Kit Kat, by the way?{\r}

1364
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:50,260
不知道  她说3点左右过来
{\fs10}I don't know, she said she'd be here around 3:00.{\r}

1365
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:53,680
你看我们还特别为她准备了紫色蛋糕
{\fs10}And you know we got purple cupcakes for her especially.{\r}

1366
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,480
她来了
{\fs10}Here she is!{\r}

1367
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,080
说曹操  曹操到
{\fs10}Speak of the devil, that will be her.{\r}

1368
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:01,310
我们等奇巧姑姑来了再吃
{\fs10}We'll wait till Aunty Kit Kat gets here.{\r}

1369
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,820
你好  吉米
{\fs10}Hey. Jimmy.{\r}

1370
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:05,490
我妹妹呢
{\fs10}Where's my sister?{\r}

1371
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:07,820
我还以为她在这里
{\fs10}Thought she was here.{\r}

1372
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:08,990
没有  她还没到
{\fs10}No, she hasn't arrived.{\r}

1373
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:12,410
这可不妙
{\fs10}That's not good.{\r}

1374
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:14,580
你什么意思
{\fs10}What does that mean?{\r}

1375
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:18,210
我们今天早上吵了一架
{\fs10}Um... We had an argument this morning.{\r}

1376
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:20,580
就鸡毛蒜皮的小事  但她喝醉了
{\fs10}Over nothing, but she'd been drinking, so...{\r}

1377
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:25,050
然后她就跑出家门开车来这
{\fs10}And then she ran out to get the car to come here and{\r}

1378
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:27,550
我跟她说在这里碰面
{\fs10}I told her to meet me here so...{\r}

1379
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:31,340
有一首巴兹·鲁尔曼的歌叫防晒霜
{\fs10}There's a song by Baz Luhrmann called Sunscreen.{\r}

1380
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:33,680
他说对未来的事情担忧
{\fs10}He says worrying about the future{\r}

1381
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,100
就像用嚼口香糖
{\fs10}is as effective as trying to solve{\r}

1382
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:38,020
解方程式一样  毫无意义
{\fs10}an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.{\r}

1383
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,770
生活中真正的麻烦
{\fs10}The real troubles in your life{\r}

1384
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:44,690
永远是你意料之外的事情
{\fs10}will always be things that never crossed your worried mind.{\r}

1385
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,410
怎么了
{\fs10}What happened?{\r}

1386
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:02,880
我们吵架了
{\fs10}We had a fight.{\r}

1387
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:04,380
然后
{\fs10}And,{\r}

1388
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:08,210
大概我还没有完全清醒
{\fs10}maybe I wasn't completely sober.{\r}

1389
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,930
-她怎么样  -不太好
{\fs10}- How is she? - Not good.{\r}

1390
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:14,390
她什么时候从哪里走的
{\fs10}When did she leave you? From where?{\r}

1391
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,760
我要精确的时间和地址
{\fs10}I want it exact. Exact time. Exact address.{\r}

1392
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:29,110
我们回来了  抱歉  抱歉
{\fs10}Here we are. Sorry, sorry.{\r}

1393
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,650
来吧
{\fs10}Come on.{\r}

1394
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,240
天啊
{\fs10}God.{\r}

1395
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:35,580
-你好  -把她接来了
{\fs10}- Hi. - There she is.{\r}

1396
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:37,910
小婴儿住在这里吗
{\fs10}Does a small baby live here?{\r}

1397
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,250
在  她可兴奋了  就在楼下
{\fs10}Yes, and she's so excited. She's downstairs.{\r}

1398
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:44,920
生日快乐  波丝
{\fs10}Happy birthday, Posy.{\r}

1399
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:49,670
抱歉  我必须去接奇巧
{\fs10}I'm sorry. I had to pick up Kit Kat.{\r}

1400
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,590
我以为她会自己开过来呢
{\fs10}I thought she was gonna drive herself.{\r}

1401
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,510
结果还是不行
{\fs10}Turns out she couldn't.{\r}

1402
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,890
-她没事吧  -再说吧
{\fs10}- She okay? - Later.{\r}

1403
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:01,180
我很担心奇巧
{\fs10}I'm worried about Kit Kat.{\r}

1404
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:05,190
我知道
{\fs10}Yeah. I know.{\r}

1405
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,860
我们喝茶的时候她一个人狂灌红酒
{\fs10}She was drinking wine while we were drinking tea.{\r}

1406
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,900
吉米对她不好
{\fs10}And Jimmy wasn't nice to her.{\r}

1407
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:15,110
而且她根本对紫色蛋糕不理不睬
{\fs10}And she spurned the purple cupcakes.{\r}

1408
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:18,240
我们得改变一下这个事实
{\fs10}We have to do something to fix it.{\r}

1409
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:21,410
对
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

1410
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:24,080
但是你要知道
{\fs10}But, you know,{\r}

1411
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:26,300
就算要改变事实
{\fs10}if it's gonna be fixed,{\r}

1412
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,050
也应该让她自己来改变
{\fs10}I think she probably has to do it herself.{\r}

1413
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:31,460
也许是
{\fs10}Maybe.{\r}

1414
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:34,010
也许不是
{\fs10}Maybe not.{\r}

1415
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:40,220
亲爱的  发生了什么事
{\fs10}My darling. What's happened?{\r}

1416
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,890
你是这个世界上最棒的人
{\fs10}You're the best person in the world.{\r}

1417
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:45,310
对我来说和我妻子一样重要  我不懂你
{\fs10}You're top equal with my wife. I don't get it.{\r}

1418
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,980
也许  只是也许
{\fs10}Maybe, just maybe,{\r}

1419
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:51,860
我是个失败者
{\fs10}I'm the faller.{\r}

1420
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:56,490
每个家族都有一个失败者
{\fs10}Every family has, like, someone who falls,{\r}

1421
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:59,780
成绩差  不停犯错
{\fs10}who doesn't make the grade, who stumbles,{\r}

1422
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:01,910
人生一团糟
{\fs10}who life trips up.{\r}

1423
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,540
也许我就是咱家的失败者
{\fs10}Maybe I'm our faller.{\r}

1424
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:08,880
不是这样的
{\fs10}No.{\r}

1425
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:18,970
好吧  我要告诉你一个秘密
{\fs10}Okay. I'm gonna tell you a secret.{\r}

1426
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,350
你得保证不会说出去
{\fs10}And you have to promise to keep it.{\r}

1427
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,020
我们一直都互相保守秘密
{\fs10}We've always kept secrets.{\r}

1428
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:24,520
是吗
{\fs10}We have?{\r}

1429
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,600
你保证你永远  永远  永远
{\fs10}You promise you won't ever, ever, ever,{\r}

1430
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:30,020
永远  永远  永远  永远
{\fs10}ever, ever, ever, ever,{\r}

1431
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:33,320
永远  永远都不说出去吗
{\fs10}ever, ever, ever, ever tell?{\r}

1432
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:34,610
好
{\fs10}Yes.{\r}

1433
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,740
我能时空旅行
{\fs10}I can travel in time.{\r}

1434
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,120
为什么咱们要站在楼梯下的柜橱里
{\fs10}Why are we standing in the cupboard under the stairs?{\r}

1435
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,580
因为我们要回到过去
{\fs10}Because we're gonna go back in{\r}

1436
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:51,760
让你对未来发生的事做出改变
{\fs10}time and you're gonna do some things differently.{\r}

1437
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,670
我就喜欢你说笑话
{\fs10}I love it when you're funny.{\r}

1438
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,050
抓住我的手  闭上眼睛
{\fs10}Grab my hand. Close your eyes.{\r}

1439
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:16,490
上帝啊  上帝啊
{\fs10}My God! My God!{\r}

1440
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,030
他妈见鬼的上帝啊
{\fs10}My arsing God in a box.{\r}

1441
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:27,000
不是吧
{\fs10}You're kidding?{\r}

1442
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,460
我可以回到任何时刻
{\fs10}I can go anywhere in time and{\r}

1443
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,790
但你却偏偏把我带到史上最烂的一次聚会
{\fs10}you bring me back to the worst party of all time.{\r}

1444
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,000
好像是  走吧
{\fs10}'Fraid so. Let's go.{\r}

1445
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:36,960
我们还有事情要做
{\fs10}We've got work to do.{\r}

1446
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,170
什么事
{\fs10}What work?{\r}

1447
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,300
确保你不会遇见吉米·金凯德
{\fs10}Making sure you do not meet Jimmy Kincade.{\r}

1448
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:42,850
快点  这里
{\fs10}Quick, in here.{\r}

1449
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,350
但是他马上就要和我坠入爱河了
{\fs10}But he's about to fall in love with me!{\r}

1450
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,100
这次不会了
{\fs10}Not this time he isn't.{\r}

1451
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:01,200
这边的美女是谁啊  你叫詹妮弗是不是
{\fs10}Who's the pretty looking girl? It's Jennifer, isn't it?{\r}

1452
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,490
是啊
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

1453
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,830
真狂野
{\fs10}Wild!{\r}

1454
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:05,280
我喜欢你的裙子  詹妮弗
{\fs10}I like your skirt, Jennifer.{\r}

1455
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:06,740
谢谢
{\fs10}Thank you.{\r}

1456
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:09,330
好吧  我懂了
{\fs10}Right, I get it.{\r}

1457
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:10,710
如果他没有遇到我
{\fs10}If he hadn't met me,{\r}

1458
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:13,540
他就会找个别的女人上床
{\fs10}he would have just had sex with someone else.{\r}

1459
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,880
要防患于未然吗
{\fs10}Nip it in the bud?{\r}

1460
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,550
不好意思  吉米
{\fs10}Excuse me, Jimmy.{\r}

1461
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,550
抱歉  我认识你吗
{\fs10}Sorry. Do I know you?{\r}

1462
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,510
对  你认识
{\fs10}Yeah, you do.{\r}

1463
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,770
咱俩很熟  抱歉
{\fs10}Very well. Sorry.{\r}

1464
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:31,230
我打一开始就应该这么做的
{\fs10}And this is what I should have done right at the start.{\r}

1465
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:40,490
新年快乐  各位  新年快乐
{\fs10}Happy New Year, everybody. Happy New Year.{\r}

1466
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:42,530
快回柜橱里去
{\fs10}And back to the cupboard.{\r}

1467
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:46,200
真惊人
{\fs10}Amazing!{\r}

1468
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:47,790
然后会发生什么
{\fs10}What happens now?{\r}

1469
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:49,200
天知道
{\fs10}God knows.{\r}

1470
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:51,710
我只希望从现在开始
{\fs10}What I'm hoping is that from this moment on you avoid{\r}

1471
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,040
你不会再招惹上这种肮脏小人了
{\fs10}the sleazy bad guys because they're sleazy and bad.{\r}

1472
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,750
你什么时候变得这么严肃了
{\fs10}When did you get so serious?{\r}

1473
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,210
自从我差点失去你那一次起
{\fs10}Since it occurred to me that I might lose you.{\r}

1474
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:04,680
准备好  接下来可能很奇怪
{\fs10}Brace yourself, this could be weird.{\r}

1475
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,180
一切都会被改变
{\fs10}Things will have changed.{\r}

1476
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,900
上帝啊
{\fs10}My God.{\r}

1477
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:16,020
什么
{\fs10}What?{\r}

1478
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:17,230
是杰
{\fs10}Jay.{\r}

1479
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,150
-你说的是那个杰吗  -对
{\fs10}- Jay Jay? - Yes.{\r}

1480
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:23,200
他很迷人  天啊
{\fs10}And he's adorable. My God.{\r}

1481
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:25,780
好吧
{\fs10}Right,{\r}

1482
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:27,910
就这么办
{\fs10}let's do this.{\r}

1483
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:35,370
你们俩快点
{\fs10}Come on, you two.{\r}

1484
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,090
妈妈刚开了一包饼干
{\fs10}Mum's just cracked open a packet of biscuits.{\r}

1485
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:47,010
我想起来有东西要给你
{\fs10}I've got something in mind for you.{\r}

1486
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,420
我知道你准备说什么
{\fs10}I know what you're gonna say.{\r}

1487
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,960
吃块饼干  然后来帮我个忙
{\fs10}Have a biscuit and come and help me.{\r}

1488
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:53,770
剩下的留给D舅舅
{\fs10}But leave the rest for Uncle D.{\r}

1489
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:58,520
其实只是收拾一下屋子
{\fs10}It's just tidying really.{\r}

1490
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,900
-你还好吗  我很想你  -很好
{\fs10}- You all right? I missed you. - Yeah.{\r}

1491
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,070
-你妈妈想让我去花园里帮忙  -好
{\fs10}- Your mum wants me to do some gardening. - Okay.{\r}

1492
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,160
就是清理一下  长得乱糟糟的
{\fs10}It's tidying up, it's all a bit out of control.{\r}

1493
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,080
所有死了的植物都清出去
{\fs10}Anything that looks dead, out.{\r}

1494
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:14,080
我们要找这个  看到了吗  全部都要
{\fs10}This is what we're looking for. Okay? All this.{\r}

1495
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,580
死掉的东西  看这个
{\fs10}Dead stuff. See this.{\r}

1496
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:20,710
都被撕成碎片了  是不是
{\fs10}They've torn them to shreds, haven't they?{\r}

1497
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,430
一切进展如何
{\fs10}How did everything go?{\r}

1498
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,310
非常令人满意
{\fs10}Immensely satisfactory.{\r}

1499
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:41,230
太好了  发生的所有事情都要告诉我
{\fs10}I'm so happy. I wanna hear all about it.{\r}

1500
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,530
你能给我们做晚饭吗  因为我有点事
{\fs10}Will you do dinner for us because there's something{\r}

1501
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:45,410
6点前必须完成  不然就要被炒了
{\fs10}I have to do before 6:00 or I'll get fired?{\r}

1502
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,740
好的  乐意之至
{\fs10}Yeah. I can't think of anything I'd love to do more.{\r}

1503
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,950
好啦  世界上最漂亮的小美人在哪里
{\fs10}Okay, where is the most fabulous person in the world?{\r}

1504
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:56,960
过来让爸爸喂你吃米粉糊糊
{\fs10}Come to your dad and get mashed up food shoved into your mouth!{\r}

1505
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,550
你好啊  小伙子
{\fs10}Hello there, little boy.{\r}

1506
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:10,930
你就
{\fs10}You just{\r}

1507
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:13,470
站在这里不要动  我马上回来
{\fs10}wait there and I'll be back in a minute.{\r}

1508
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,740
爸  我能跟你稍微谈一下吗
{\fs10}Dad, can I have a quick word?{\r}

1509
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:29,660
好的  没问题
{\fs10}Yeah. Sure.{\r}

1510
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,490
我不能回到出生以前的时间了  是不是
{\fs10}I can't go back past the birth again, can I?{\r}

1511
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:35,410
不行  我应该跟你说的
{\fs10}No. I should have mentioned that.{\r}

1512
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,040
出生之前都没关系  但那个特定的时间点
{\fs10}You're okay till it comes out but the exact{\r}

1513
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,670
一个特定的精子让你们有了
{\fs10}sperm at the exact moment got you this{\r}

1514
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:42,080
这个孩子
{\fs10}particular baby,{\r}

1515
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:43,920
所以如果你造成了任何一点细微变化
{\fs10}so if you do anything the tiniest bit{\r}

1516
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,800
你生出来的孩子就会不同
{\fs10}different, you'll have a different child.{\r}

1517
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:52,600
那昨天以前就再也不能变了吗  定格了
{\fs10}So, every day up 'til yesterday is as it will always be? Lost?{\r}

1518
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:55,810
和其他人一样
{\fs10}Just like for everyone else.{\r}

1519
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,850
好吧  很有意思
{\fs10}Okay. Interesting.{\r}

1520
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,310
真难办  我爱你  爸爸  我得走了
{\fs10}Tough. I love you, Dad. I've gotta go.{\r}

1521
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:27,630
回去吧
{\fs10}Go home.{\r}

1522
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:29,320
除非能保证这种事情再也不发生
{\fs10}We're not leaving this room until we find{\r}

1523
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:33,180
否则我们绝对不会离开这个房间一步
{\fs10}a way of making sure this never happens again.{\r}

1524
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,730
你们现在该走了吧
{\fs10}Will you go now?{\r}

1525
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,420
我必须得离开吉米  是不是
{\fs10}I have to leave Jimmy, don't I?{\r}

1526
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:05,920
永远
{\fs10}For good.{\r}

1527
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,260
而且我得戒酒
{\fs10}And I have to stop drinking.{\r}

1528
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:15,090
而且不能再随便换工作了
{\fs10}And stop leaving jobs.{\r}

1529
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:21,180
而且我要和一个无聊的好人
{\fs10}And I have to go out with someone{\r}

1530
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,600
谈恋爱
{\fs10}nice and boring.{\r}

1531
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:28,770
终于觉悟了
{\fs10}Yay.{\r}

1532
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:35,240
对了  好人不一定无聊
{\fs10}And, you know, nice isn't necessarily boring.{\r}

1533
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,620
比如?
{\fs10}Like who?{\r}

1534
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,240
马特·达蒙
{\fs10}Matt Damon?{\r}

1535
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:40,950
好耶
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

1536
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,540
我会和马特·达蒙约会的
{\fs10}I'll go out with Matt Damon.{\r}

1537
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:46,880
跟我讲  你最近见过杰吗
{\fs10}Tell me, have you seen Jay recently?{\r}

1538
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,390
你的那个头发翘翘的杰吗
{\fs10}Your Jay? What, sticky-up hair Jay?{\r}

1539
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:51,460
看起来就像个提线木偶的杰吗
{\fs10}Looks a bit like a muppet Jay?{\r}

1540
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:52,590
对
{\fs10}Yes.{\r}

1541
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,390
我突然想到了他  他一直对你很有好感
{\fs10}He just popped into my head. He's always had a crush on you.{\r}

1542
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,760
-真的吗  -真的
{\fs10}- Really? - Yeah.{\r}

1543
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:01,600
好诡异
{\fs10}Weird!{\r}

1544
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:04,100
考虑一下约他吃晚饭  你有时间吗
{\fs10}Thinking of asking him to dinner. Are you free?{\r}

1545
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:07,980
可能吧  也许得先梳妆打扮一下
{\fs10}Might be. Might have to freshen up a bit first.{\r}

1546
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:10,360
没错  你看起来惨死了
{\fs10}Yeah. You look shit.{\r}

1547
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:18,410
乔安娜
{\fs10}Joanna.{\r}

1548
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:19,950
感谢上帝  你们终于回来了
{\fs10}Thank Christ you're back.{\r}

1549
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,660
这就是一场恶梦
{\fs10}It's been a total nightmare.{\r}

1550
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:23,450
我懂  不过没关系的
{\fs10}I know. It's all fine anyway.{\r}

1551
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,080
她在哪里
{\fs10}Where is she?{\r}

1552
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:27,070
这是我这辈子最糟糕的一晚
{\fs10}It was the single worst night of my life.{\r}

1553
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:28,500
波丝在哪里
{\fs10}Where's Posy?{\r}

1554
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:31,670
找到啦  你好啊
{\fs10}There she is! Hello!{\r}

1555
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,510
你好啊  你好
{\fs10}Hello! Hello.{\r}

1556
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:36,840
亲爱的  你怎么样啊
{\fs10}Darling, how are you doing?{\r}

1557
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:42,350
咱再生一个吧
{\fs10}Let's have another one.{\r}

1558
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:47,190
去死吧  不要
{\fs10}Screw that. No.{\r}

1559
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:52,070
生孩子很疼的  而且会变胖  肥得流油
{\fs10}That hurt and I got fat. Like fat-fat.{\r}

1560
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:54,490
只胖了一点点  不是吗
{\fs10}Got a little bit fat, didn't she.{\r}

1561
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:56,780
跟妈妈说你想要个小妹妹
{\fs10}Tell Mummy you want a sister.{\r}

1562
01:30:56,910 --> 01:31:00,990
不要  跟爸爸说你当独生女很高兴
{\fs10}No. Tell Daddy you're happy being an only child.{\r}

1563
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,120
幸运的是  我们都还是无所顾忌的年轻人
{\fs10}Fortunately we are young and careless and{\r}

1564
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:07,670
不久之后我们就变成了四口之家
{\fs10}it wasn't long before there were four of us.{\r}

1565
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:11,170
不可思议  只有三岁的波丝·莱克
{\fs10}And this is incredible. Posy Lake, only 3 years old,{\r}

1566
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:14,260
马上就打破女子10米跑的奥运会纪录了
{\fs10}is about to break the women's 10 metre Olympic record.{\r}

1567
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:16,820
他们会成功的  他们跑过来了
{\fs10}They're gonna do it. And here they are,{\r}

1568
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:18,510
他们做到了  了不起
{\fs10}they've done it! Fantastic.{\r}

1569
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,350
你太棒了  表现真好
{\fs10}That was brilliant. You're so good.{\r}

1570
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:22,890
这么吵都没被吵醒
{\fs10}Sleeping right through all that.{\r}

1571
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,270
能帮个忙吗  我好紧张
{\fs10}Can you help me? I'm so nervous.{\r}

1572
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:27,690
我们跟畅销书作者吃饭时穿什么比较好
{\fs10}What do I wear for dinner with our bestselling author?{\r}

1573
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:30,350
先让我把怪兽画完  我就马上上去
{\fs10}Let me finish up with the monsters and I'll come right up.{\r}

1574
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,690
好极了  谢谢
{\fs10}Great. Thank you.{\r}

1575
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:33,440
继续
{\fs10}Go again.{\r}

1576
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:36,490
好啦  这件怎么样
{\fs10}Okay. How about this?{\r}

1577
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:39,110
很漂亮  任务完成  很好
{\fs10}That's gorgeous. Job done. Yeah.{\r}

1578
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:42,410
不行  认真点挑  这个
{\fs10}No. Take it seriously. It's...{\r}

1579
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:46,040
我不确定  不行  我不喜欢
{\fs10}I don't know. No, I hate it.{\r}

1580
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:48,080
-没错  -这件没有亮点
{\fs10}- Yeah. - It's boring and{\r}

1581
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:51,460
而且让我看起来疙疙瘩瘩的
{\fs10}makes me look kind of lumpy.{\r}

1582
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:52,410
没错  你说得对
{\fs10}No, you're right.{\r}

1583
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:54,380
确实没亮点  又都是疙瘩  我不喜欢
{\fs10}It is boring and lumpy. I hate it.{\r}

1584
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:58,130
好吧  那这件呢
{\fs10}Okay. What about this?{\r}

1585
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:00,470
美极了  就是它了
{\fs10}Gorgeous. We did it.{\r}

1586
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:03,180
不行  胸露太多了
{\fs10}No, it's too breasty.{\r}

1587
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:05,390
-是吗  -好吧
{\fs10}- Is it? - Okay.{\r}

1588
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,520
这件没有很显胸
{\fs10}It's not too breasty.{\r}

1589
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,730
不行  这双高跟鞋不能穿  看起来像妓女
{\fs10}No. I'm not wearing these heels. I look like a prostitute.{\r}

1590
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:11,440
那就别穿高跟鞋了
{\fs10}Not high heels, then.{\r}

1591
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,150
但是那样又会让腿显得很短
{\fs10}But then we have the short legs problem.{\r}

1592
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:15,770
那你是想看起来像妓女还是矮子
{\fs10}Well, do you want to look like a prostitute or a dwarf?{\r}

1593
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,030
小心  小心点说话
{\fs10}Warning. That's a warning.{\r}

1594
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:23,740
很好
{\fs10}Yes!{\r}

1595
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:24,870
不好
{\fs10}No.{\r}

1596
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:29,790
不行
{\fs10}No!{\r}

1597
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:32,920
这件我喜欢
{\fs10}Now that I like.{\r}

1598
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:35,670
不是  我还在挑裙子
{\fs10}No, I'm just picking up the dress{\r}

1599
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,300
这件是打底的  你真是个坏人
{\fs10}that this goes under. Such a bad boy.{\r}

1600
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,800
这一件呢
{\fs10}This one?{\r}

1601
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:43,010
不算太坏
{\fs10}Not bad.{\r}

1602
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,970
还有这一件呢
{\fs10}Or this one?{\r}

1603
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,600
-你在考我吧  这是同一件  -不是
{\fs10}It's a trick question, isn't it? Same dress. - No!{\r}

1604
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:49,180
不是吗
{\fs10}No?{\r}

1605
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,770
好啦  我觉得这件还不赖
{\fs10}Okay. I don't think this one's too bad.{\r}

1606
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:53,850
没错  很漂亮
{\fs10}Yeah, it's fabulous.{\r}

1607
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:55,940
-真的吗  -真的
{\fs10}- Really? - Yeah.{\r}

1608
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,400
好吧  不错
{\fs10}Okay. Great. Good.{\r}

1609
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,780
那件蓝色的怎么样
{\fs10}How about the blue one?{\r}

1610
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:02,740
- 蓝色的  -是啊
{\fs10}- The blue one? - Yeah.{\r}

1611
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:03,570
行啊
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

1612
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:06,870
你是说没亮点又疙瘩的那件吗
{\fs10}The first one that you tried on that was boring and lumpy,{\r}

1613
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:08,550
而实际上  它很惊艳  也不疙瘩
{\fs10}but that wasn't actually boring and lumpy,{\r}

1614
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:09,120
是那件吗
{\fs10}that one?{\r}

1615
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,120
对的  你觉得哪件好
{\fs10}Yeah, which do you prefer?{\r}

1616
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,170
我不知道  跟你说  我快疯了
{\fs10}I don't know. I'm actually starting to go mad.{\r}

1617
01:33:13,290 --> 01:33:14,670
我貌似还是喜欢蓝色那件
{\fs10}I think I like the blue one.{\r}

1618
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:16,210
-好吧  -就这样
{\fs10}- Okay. - Yeah.{\r}

1619
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:20,260
好了好了  我还是穿这件走
{\fs10}Okay. Okay, let's go with this one, then?{\r}

1620
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:22,220
你美翻了
{\fs10}You look amazing.{\r}

1621
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:23,510
-真的吗  -真心的
{\fs10}- Really? - Yes.{\r}

1622
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,220
那多谢了
{\fs10}Okay, thanks.{\r}

1623
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,430
我的天啊
{\fs10}God.{\r}

1624
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:29,640
波丝哪去了
{\fs10}Where's Posy?{\r}

1625
01:33:29,930 --> 01:33:31,770
我让她呆在楼下呢
{\fs10}I left her downstairs.{\r}

1626
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:35,560
我放手稿那屋的门关了吧
{\fs10}Not leaving the door open to the room with the manuscript in it?{\r}

1627
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:38,270
貌似没有
{\fs10}I don't think so.{\r}

1628
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:41,530
看着我  看着我的眼睛
{\fs10}Look at me. Look me in the eye.{\r}

1629
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:42,910
告诉我怎么办
{\fs10}And talk me through this.{\r}

1630
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:45,070
-我离死不远了  -好啦
{\fs10}- Basically my life is over. - OK.{\r}

1631
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,780
我出去两分钟  也许一分钟就够
{\fs10}I really need to go out for just like two minutes, maybe one.{\r}

1632
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:49,580
你敢
{\fs10}Don't you dare!{\r}

1633
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:53,210
你敢接  我该怎么办
{\fs10}Don't you dare answer that! What am I gonna do?{\r}

1634
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,790
我觉得我们真的该接电话了
{\fs10}I think that we should really answer the phone.{\r}

1635
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:57,290
你要是接了那鬼电话
{\fs10}If you answer the goddamn phone,{\r}

1636
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:58,880
我就用电话砸死你
{\fs10}I will kill you with the phone.{\r}

1637
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,090
我不接电话  但是我真的要出去一下
{\fs10}I won't answer the phone, but I do need to get out.{\r}

1638
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:04,220
不行  不准出去  不准  不行
{\fs10}No, no getting out, no getting out. No.{\r}

1639
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,840
好吧
{\fs10}Okay, right.{\r}

1640
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:07,550
抱歉啊  麦克尤恩先生
{\fs10}Sorry, Mr McEwan.{\r}

1641
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,030
您的作品我们看了一大部分了  但是吧
{\fs10}We read most of your book but,{\r}

1642
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:14,350
剩下那些有的染了色  有的碎成了渣
{\fs10}you see, the rest of it was coloured on or shredded.{\r}

1643
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:16,690
对的
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

1644
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:19,770
我没想到波丝会用碎纸机
{\fs10}I had no idea Posy actually knew how to use that machine{\r}

1645
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:21,980
这么想来  还挺值得高兴的
{\fs10}in a way that's impressive.{\r}

1646
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:26,200
干嘛啊  有什么事
{\fs10}What is it? How can I help you?{\r}

1647
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:30,580
是玛丽啊
{\fs10}Oh, Mary.{\r}

1648
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,870
不是的  一切都...抱歉
{\fs10}No, everything... Sorry.{\r}

1649
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:36,710
让你儿子解释吧
{\fs10}Your son will explain.{\r}

1650
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:38,330
是你老妈
{\fs10}It's your mother.{\r}

1651
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,340
喂  妈
{\fs10}Hi, Mum.{\r}

1652
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,840
不不不  没事  我们...
{\fs10}No, no, it's okay. We'll...{\r}

1653
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:49,800
我们马上就去
{\fs10}We'll come straight down.{\r}

1654
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,010
好的  再见
{\fs10}Okay, bye-bye.{\r}

1655
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:07,950
回来啦  亲爱的
{\fs10}Hello, darling.{\r}

1656
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:09,450
妈妈  你好吗
{\fs10}Mum. How are you?{\r}

1657
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:11,620
想听真话吗
{\fs10}Honestly?{\r}

1658
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:12,790
当然
{\fs10}Why not?{\r}

1659
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,870
气死我了
{\fs10}I am fucking furious.{\r}

1660
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:21,170
没你爸爸的生活索然无味啊
{\fs10}I am so uninterested in a life without your father.{\r}

1661
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:24,630
玛丽  走吧  我们泡点茶去
{\fs10}Mary. Come on, let's make some tea.{\r}

1662
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:26,630
你还好吗
{\fs10}How are you?{\r}

1663
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:27,880
挺好的
{\fs10}Yeah, I'm fine.{\r}

1664
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:29,130
吃饭了吗
{\fs10}Did you eat?{\r}

1665
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:30,390
吃了的
{\fs10}Yes, of course.{\r}

1666
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:37,480
德斯蒙德
{\fs10}Desmond.{\r}

1667
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,730
您过得如何
{\fs10}How are you?{\r}

1668
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:41,560
我很好  谢谢关心
{\fs10}I'm very well, thanks.{\r}

1669
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:43,650
就是有点热
{\fs10}Though a little hot.{\r}

1670
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:50,490
你爸可能不太好
{\fs10}Your father, I think, is not so well.{\r}

1671
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:52,570
得了癌症
{\fs10}Cancer.{\r}

1672
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:54,830
是啊
{\fs10}Yes.{\r}

1673
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:57,790
蒂姆  我真的很难过
{\fs10}I'm very unhappy about it, Tim.{\r}

1674
01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:01,790
他在你婚礼上说他爱我
{\fs10}At your wedding he said he loved me.{\r}

1675
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:04,290
-他确实很爱你  -我知道的
{\fs10}- He does. - I know.{\r}

1676
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,590
那是我今生最美好的日子
{\fs10}That was the best day of my life.{\r}

1677
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:13,510
今天可能是最糟糕的日子
{\fs10}So this is probably the worst.{\r}

1678
01:36:19,770 --> 01:36:20,770
爸
{\fs10}Dad.{\r}

1679
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:24,940
我的上帝
{\fs10}For God's sake.{\r}

1680
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,320
你也来这套
{\fs10}Not you, too.{\r}

1681
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,490
什么
{\fs10}What?{\r}

1682
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:30,920
奇巧刚刚哭着走了
{\fs10}Well, Kit Kat's just rolled up blubbing her eyes out{\r}

1683
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,360
现在你又来了
{\fs10}and now you're here.{\r}

1684
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:33,910
妈妈怎么跟你说的
{\fs10}What's Mum been saying?{\r}

1685
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:35,160
实话实说的
{\fs10}The truth.{\r}

1686
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:36,330
好吧
{\fs10}Yeah, well,{\r}

1687
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,160
还说什么了
{\fs10}apart from that?{\r}

1688
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,800
可能是抽烟造成的
{\fs10}It may have been the smoking{\r}

1689
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,350
但这个我改变不了
{\fs10}but I couldn't undo that{\r}

1690
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:45,670
因为在你们出生前我就抽烟了
{\fs10}as it was before you were all born.{\r}

1691
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:46,820
不管怎么说
{\fs10}And anyway,{\r}

1692
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:49,000
要不是我抽烟的样子特别帅
{\fs10}your mother definitely wouldn't have gone out with me{\r}

1693
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,330
你妈绝对不会跟我谈恋爱的
{\fs10}if I hadn't been such a sexy smoker.{\r}

1694
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:56,950
我这发现的也算早的了
{\fs10}I did get diagnosed as soon as possible,{\r}

1695
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:58,560
但还是太晚了
{\fs10}but it was too late.{\r}

1696
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,730
还有多少日子
{\fs10}How long have we got?{\r}

1697
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:07,070
可能  可能几年吧
{\fs10}You know, it, it could be years.{\r}

1698
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:11,530
到底多久
{\fs10}How long really?{\r}

1699
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,870
恐怕也就几周
{\fs10}Weeks, I'm afraid.{\r}

1700
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:25,880
我们以前是不是有过这个对话了
{\fs10}Have we had this conversation before?{\r}

1701
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:29,760
是的
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

1702
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:33,220
然后发生了什么
{\fs10}What happened?{\r}

1703
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:35,890
我很难过
{\fs10}I rather let myself down.{\r}

1704
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:37,970
我拥抱了你
{\fs10}I hugged you.{\r}

1705
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:58,200
抱歉
{\fs10}Sorry.{\r}

1706
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,040
我刚在考虑时间旅行的问题
{\fs10}I think I just thought with the time thing...{\r}

1707
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:03,790
不行  我从没说过我们能修正生活
{\fs10}No, I never said we could fix things.{\r}

1708
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,040
我绝对没那么说过
{\fs10}I specifically never said that.{\r}

1709
01:38:06,170 --> 01:38:08,670
生活总是喜忧参半  无论你是谁
{\fs10}Life's a mixed bag, no matter who you are.{\r}

1710
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,710
拿耶稣来说  他是神的儿子
{\fs10}Look at Jesus. He was the Son of God,{\r}

1711
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:11,720
就算看在上帝份上吧
{\fs10}for God's sake,{\r}

1712
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:12,800
但是你看他结局怎样
{\fs10}and look how that turned out.{\r}

1713
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,170
我知道的  但是...
{\fs10}I know, but...{\r}

1714
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:17,590
我还是想说  我觉得有点受骗了
{\fs10}you must see I feel a bit cheated.{\r}

1715
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:18,200
别那么想
{\fs10}Don't.{\r}

1716
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,140
实际上  你可以换个角度
{\fs10}In fact, feel the opposite.{\r}

1717
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:22,770
唯一一个50岁就退休的人
{\fs10}The only people who give up work at 50{\r}

1718
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:25,140

{\fs10}are the time travellers with cancer{\r}

1719
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:27,560

{\fs10}who want to play more table tennis with their sons.{\r}

1720
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:30,690
是啊
{\fs10}Right.{\r}

1721
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,490

{\fs10}So that's been the deal?{\r}

1722
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,810
很抱歉  我们必须得打给你
{\fs10}I'm sorry we had to call.{\r}

1723

1725
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:51,340
或者说  我看看
{\fs10}Or, let me check,{\r}

1726
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:54,300

{\fs10}do you want to know the big secret,{\r}

1727
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:56,680
还是像我一样自己去发现
{\fs10}or would you rather find it out for yourself like I did?{\r}

1728
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,840

{\fs10}Christ, there's another secret?{\r}

1729
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:02,850

1730
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,270

1732
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:13,650
我们别浪费时间了
{\fs10}Let's save some time.{\r}

1733
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:22,530
于是他告诉了我他关于幸福的秘密公式
{\fs10}And so he told me his secret formula for happiness.{\r}

1734
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:26,620
这个规划分两部分  第一部分是
{\fs10}Part one of the two part plan{\r}

1735
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:28,790

1736
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,880

{\fs10}almost exactly the same.{\r}

1765
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:08,890
第一遍充斥着各种压力和忧虑
{\fs10}The first time with all the tensions and worries that{\r}

1766
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,770

{\fs10}stop us noticing how sweet the world can be,{\r}

1767
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:14,650

{\fs10}Let's give it a go.{\r}

1770
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:25,870

{\fs10}I know it doesn't seem that way{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

1773
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:36,680
鲁伯特  这个不行
{\fs10}Rupert, this does not pass.{\r}

{\fs10}Is this the best you can do?{\r}

1775
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:42,680
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}但也许当前就是最好的时光
{\fs10}But maybe it's the perfect day{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

1776
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:42,220
你俩把这玩意搞定
{\fs10}I'll leave you two to thrash this out.{\r}

1777
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:43,680
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}他就是个傻逼

1778
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:46,220
就算账单如山
{\fs10}Even though the bills are piling{\r}

1779
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:51,260
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}也没有幸运女神临幸
{\fs10}And maybe Lady Luck ain't smiling{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

1780
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:50,850
-下午好  先生  -下午好
{\fs10}- Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon.{\r}

1781

1782
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:53,480
带走吧
{\fs10}Take away.{\r}

1783
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:54,770
要口袋吗
{\fs10}Would you like a bag?{\r}

1784
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,150
拿一个吧
{\fs10}That's fine.{\r}

1785
01:41:56,150 --> 01:42:00,150
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}但是只要我们勇于面对
{\fs10}But if we'd  only open our eyes{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

1786

您好
{\fs10}Hello, there.{\r}

1790
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:05,070
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}就会发现上帝在默默庇护
{\fs10}We'd see the blessings in disguise{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

1791

{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}积云成雨  汇集成河
{\fs10}That all the rain clouds are fountains{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

1793
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,870
这里是不是很漂亮
{\fs10}Isn't this room beautiful?{\r}

1794
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:10,160
是啊
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

1795
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:12,040
快走吧
{\fs10}Come on.{\r}

1796
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:15,040
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}尽管困难如山
{\fs10}Though our troubles seem like mountains{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

1797
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:14,160
无罪
{\fs10}Not guilty.{\r}

1798
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:21,160
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}风雨过后  终现阳光
{\fs10}There's gold in them hills{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

1799

太棒了
{\fs10}Fantastic!{\r}

1800
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:26,160

{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}所以不要沮丧  不要灰心
{\fs10}So don't lose heart{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

1802
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:35,160
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}给今天一个重新开始的机会
{\fs10}Give the day a chance to start{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

所以今天过得还不赖
{\fs10}So not such a bad day after all?{\r}

1806

这给我减轻负担了
{\fs10}Well, that's a relief,{\r}

1809
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,760
如果你今天过得很糟的话
{\fs10}because if it had been a very bad day,{\r}

1810
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:11,480
我可能还得和你做个爱
{\fs10}I thought I might have had to have had sex with you{\r}

1811
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,220
来调整一下你的情绪

晚安

{\fs10}It was a very, very bad day.{\r}

1814
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,650
简直糟到爆
{\fs10}It went very, very badly.{\r}

1815
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:28,450
我被炒了鱿鱼
{\fs10}I got fired from my job.{\r}

1816
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,450
还杀了一个人
{\fs10}And then I killed a man.{\r}

1817
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:39,290
那可真够糟的

{\fs10}- It's terrible. - Yeah.{\r}

1819

史上最倒霉的一天
{\fs10}Like the worst day ever.{\r}

1820
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:46,970
我真为你难过
{\fs10}So sorry.{\r}

1821

当然了
{\fs10}Some days, of course,{\r}

1822
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:55,470
有些日子  你不想经历第二次
{\fs10}though, you only want to go through once.{\r}

1823
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:57,480
你还好吗

我不相信干涉主义的上帝
{\fs10}I don't believe in an interventionist God{\r}

1825

{\fs10}Not to intervene when it came to you{\r\fn方正黑体简体\bord1\shad1\an8\3c&H2F2F2F&}

1830
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:59,370
等我一分钟
{\fs10}Just give me one minute.{\r}

1831
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:07,480
你的一根头发都不要触碰
{\fs10}Oh, not to touch a hair on your head{\r}

1832
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:10,480
让你保持本来的样子

1833
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:13,480

{\fs10}If he felt he had to direct you{\r}

1834
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,480
就指引你到我怀中
{\fs10}Then direct you into my arms{\r}

1835
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:23,730
写得太棒了
{\fs10}This is so brilliant.{\r}

1836
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:29,320
狄更斯对插科打诨真是在行
{\fs10}Dickens is so good on actual jokes, actual gags.{\r}

1837
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,990
你从哪来的
{\fs10}Where have you come from?{\r}

1838

1840
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,740
那个重要的日子

01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:39,480
谢谢你来看我
{\fs10}Thanks for dropping in.{\r}

1842
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:42,040
德斯蒙德叔叔的西装怎么样
{\fs10}How's Uncle Desmond's suit?{\r}

1843
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:44,000
完美无瑕
{\fs10}Immaculate.{\r}

1844

很好
{\fs10}Excellent.{\r}

1845
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,600
我提过我想放尼克·凯夫的歌吗
{\fs10}Did I mention I wanted the Nick Cave track?{\r}

1846
01:45:47,670 --> 01:45:49,340
都记着呢

1848
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:53,590
我给你读读这一小段行吗
{\fs10}Can I just read you this one bit?{\r}

1849
01:45:57,930 --> 01:46:00,430
尽管读吧  我有的是时间
{\fs10}Read away, I've got lots of time.{\r}

1850
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,980
我想  古代的罗马人相互激怒结怨
{\fs10}"I think the Romans must have aggravated{\r}

1851
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:05,770
一定是因为彼此的鼻子
{\fs10}"one another very much with their noses.{\r}

1852
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:07,000
也许正是由于这个原因
{\fs10}"Perhaps they became{\r}

1853
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,440
罗马人成了历史上一个不安分守己的民族
{\fs10}"the restless people they were in consequence.{\r}

1854
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:10,240
无论如何
{\fs10}"Anyhow,{\r}

1855
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:12,780
沃甫赛先生那罗马人的鹰钩鼻也激怒了我
{\fs10}"Mr Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me..."{\r}

1856
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:17,780

但我相信有爱
{\fs10}But I believe in love{\r}

1861
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:50,780
我知道你也相信
{\fs10}And I know that you do too{\r}

1862
01:46:56,780 --> 01:47:00,780
我相信有一条路
{\fs10}And I believe in some kind of path{\r}

1863
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:10,780
我们可以同行  你和我
{\fs10}That we can walk down, me and you{\r}

1864
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:15,780
燃着你的蜡烛

1865
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:18,780
让她的旅程纯净明亮
{\fs10}Make her journey bright and pure{\r}

1866
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:21,780
把回来的路铭记于心
{\fs10}That she will keep returning{\r}

1867
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:23,780
永远铭记
{\fs10}Always and evermore{\r}

01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:31,780
到我怀中  上帝
{\fs10}Into my arms, oh Lord{\r}

1869
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:36,780
到我怀中  上帝
{\fs10}Into my arms, oh Lord{\r}

1870
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:41,780
到我怀中  上帝
{\fs10}Into my arms, oh Lord{\r}

1871
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:45,780
到我怀中
{\fs10}Into my arms{\r}

1872
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:51,000
孩子的事  你有什么看法
{\fs10}What do you think about the kids?{\r}

1873
01:47:51,130 --> 01:47:52,630
他们怎么了
{\fs10}What about them?{\r}

1874
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:55,880
不够多吧  是不
{\fs10}Not many of them, are there?{\r}

1875
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:57,970
什么
{\fs10}What?{\r}

1876
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,680
我是说  两个太少了
{\fs10}Well, I mean two?{\r}

1877
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:05,850
在中国就算超生了
{\fs10}It's more than the Chinese are allowed.{\r}

1878
01:48:07,810 --> 01:48:10,480
我就是想吧  也许
{\fs10}I just thought that maybe, you know,{\r}

1879
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:13,310
我们该再生一个  以防万一
{\fs10}it was time for the insurance baby.{\r}

1880
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:14,400
以防什么万一
{\fs10}What?{\r}

1881
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:15,900
以防万一某个孩子特别聪明
{\fs10}In case one of them is really smart,{\r}

1882
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:17,060
我们不希望另一个孩子
{\fs10}we don't want the other one{\r}

1883
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:18,380
一辈子都觉得自己很笨
{\fs10}to feel stupid their whole life.{\r}

1884
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:20,160
如果我们生了第三个
{\fs10}And if we had a third one,{\r}

1885
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:22,700
两个小傻瓜就能快乐地作伴了
{\fs10}then we could have two happy dummies.{\r}

1886
01:48:25,490 --> 01:48:27,160
你觉得怎么样
{\fs10}What do you think?{\r}

1887
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:34,000
这是我一生中最艰难的决定
{\fs10}It was the toughest decision of my life.{\r}

1888
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:36,920
迎接新生意味着
{\fs10}Saying 'yes' to the future meant{\r}

1889
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:39,420
与爸爸的永别
{\fs10}saying 'goodbye' to my dad. Forever.{\r}

1890
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:43,220
我们为什么不再等等呢
{\fs10}Why don't we wait a bit?{\r}

1891
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:47,270
当然了
{\fs10}Absolutely.{\r}

1892
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:50,100
你说的没错
{\fs10}You're right. Yeah.{\r}

1893
01:48:54,730 --> 01:48:57,530
是现在呢
{\fs10}How about now?{\r}

1894
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:00,780
还是现在呢
{\fs10}Or now?{\r}

1895
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,280
现在吧
{\fs10}Now?{\r}

1896
01:49:11,710 --> 01:49:12,710
好吧
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

1897
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,080
我同意
{\fs10}Okay.{\r}

1898
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:17,630
真的吗
{\fs10}Really?{\r}

1899
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,590
爸爸一直希望我们再要个孩子
{\fs10}Dad always wished there had been more of us.{\r}

1900
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,390
所以...
{\fs10}So...{\r}

1901
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:29,470
不过  我们也不一定能怀上
{\fs10}Anyway, we might try and nothing happens.{\r}

1902
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:31,060
确实
{\fs10}Exactly.{\r}

1903
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:41,820
可能今晚就要生了
{\fs10}Really could be tonight.{\r}

1904
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:44,410
你绝对想象不到
{\fs10}And you cannot believe the detail in which{\r}

1905
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:46,410
我多熟悉去医院的路
{\fs10}I know the route to the hospital.{\r}

1906
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:47,830
是啊
{\fs10}Yay.{\r}

1907
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:53,000
你能等我一下吗
{\fs10}Will you excuse me for a sec?{\r}

1908
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,580
我下趟楼
{\fs10}Just have to go downstairs.{\r}

1909
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:15,270
现在比分17比20  比赛十分激烈
{\fs10}And it's 17-20 in this incredibly tight contest{\r}

1910
01:50:15,350 --> 01:50:17,150
两位运动员都是
{\fs10}being played by the two most physically{\r}

1911
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:19,020
史上最佳的选手
{\fs10}perfect players in the history of the game.{\r}

1912
01:50:19,190 --> 01:50:22,030
观众为年轻选手而着迷
{\fs10}The crowd, enchanted by the younger player, are seduced{\r}

1913
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:24,860
也被老选手的辉煌过去所吸引
{\fs10}by memories of the older player's illustrious past.{\r}

1914
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:28,870
天啊  我赢了
{\fs10}My God, I've won.{\r}

1915
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:32,040
我多少年没赢过了
{\fs10}I haven't won in years.{\r}

1916
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:34,500
你可总算赢了
{\fs10}You finally got good.{\r}

1917
01:50:35,210 --> 01:50:36,620
该给我颁什么奖
{\fs10}What's my prize?{\r}

1918
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:38,840
当然了  除了奥运会金奖以外
{\fs10}Apart from the Olympic gold medal, of course.{\r}

1919
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,090
给你一个吻
{\fs10}A kiss will have to do.{\r}

1920
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:44,220
一个吻?
{\fs10}A kiss?{\r}

1921
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,510
我明白了
{\fs10}I get you.{\r}

1922
01:50:52,890 --> 01:50:54,390
到时间了吧
{\fs10}This is it, then?{\r}

1923
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:57,730
到时间了
{\fs10}This is it.{\r}

1924
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,730
这是我最后的一点时间了
{\fs10}It's my last bit of extra time.{\r}

1925
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:03,650
孩子马上就要出生了
{\fs10}The baby is completely on the way.{\r}

1926
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,090
恭喜你
{\fs10}Congratulations.{\r}

1927
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:34,600
我的儿子
{\fs10}My son.{\r}

1928
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:39,560
我的爸爸
{\fs10}My dad.{\r}

1929
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,570
有什么我能做的
{\fs10}Is there anything at all I can do?{\r}

1930
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,780
有什么你想做的
{\fs10}Is there anything you want to do?{\r}

1931
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:53,240
我不知道  就有这么...
{\fs10}I don't know. There is this...{\r}

1932
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:56,700
一件事
{\fs10}one thing.{\r}

1933
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,120
去散个小步
{\fs10}A quick little walk.{\r}

1934
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:01,130
当然了  这是完全违背规则的
{\fs10}Totally against the rules, of course,{\r}

1935
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:03,130
但是如果我们不做任何改变
{\fs10}but if we don't change a thing,{\r}

1936
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:06,800
足够小心的话  就没什么事
{\fs10}if we're very careful, it shouldn't do any harm.{\r}

1937
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:08,930
会很棒的
{\fs10}It would be nice.{\r}

1938
01:52:39,330 --> 01:52:42,330
我尽力了  我真的尽力了
{\fs10}I'm really trying. I'm really trying.{\r}

1939
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:45,460
低一点
{\fs10}Get down low.{\r}

1940
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:51,180
我完胜你
{\fs10}Total defeat.{\r}

1941
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:02,270
我累了
{\fs10}I'm tired.{\r}

1942
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:04,690
谢谢你  爸爸
{\fs10}Thanks, Dad.{\r}

1943
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:23,040
我的故事也快讲完了
{\fs10}So I'm almost up-to-date with my story.{\r}

1944
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:24,560
和别的家庭一样
{\fs10}As all families do,{\r}

1945
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:27,040
我们渐渐适应了亲人离世后的生活
{\fs10}we got used to life after death.{\r}

1946
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:29,050
过得依然很好
{\fs10}And it was still fine.{\r}

1947
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,120
日复一日
{\fs10}And things settled back into their traditional rhythms{\r}

1948
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:34,010
一切都回到正轨
{\fs10}season after season,{\r}

1949
01:53:34,470 --> 01:53:36,890
和过去一样
{\fs10}and are much as they have always been.{\r}

1950
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:40,890
我们也适应了奇巧重新快乐起来的样子
{\fs10}And we've got used to Kit Kat being happy again.{\r}

1951
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:44,350
然后适应了她当妈妈的样子
{\fs10}And then we got used to her being a mum.{\r}

1952
01:53:44,730 --> 01:53:46,130
虽然她这个妈妈不是特别称职
{\fs10}Albeit not a very good{\r}

1953
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:47,400
甚至很没安全感
{\fs10}or even safe one.{\r}

1954
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:50,190
最后的最后
{\fs10}And in the end,{\r}

1955
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:53,990
我学到了我时光旅行的最后一课
{\fs10}I think I've learned the final lesson from my travels in time.{\r}

1956
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:57,830
我甚至还比我爸爸更进了一步
{\fs10}And I've even gone one step further than my father did.{\r}

1957
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,460
好吧  我去照顾孩子
{\fs10}Okay, I'll do the kids.{\r}

1958
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:14,880
不用  别担心  我会去的
{\fs10}No, don't worry. I'll do them.{\r}

1959
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:16,680
好  你来  你个懒蛋
{\fs10}Yeah, you do them, you lazy bum.{\r}

1960
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:19,810
实际上  我现在从不穿越回过去
{\fs10}The truth is, I now don't travel back at all.{\r}

1961
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:21,850
一天也不
{\fs10}Not even for the day.{\r}

1962
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:24,850
我努力过好每一天
{\fs10}I just try to live every day{\r}

1963
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:27,610
就像我已经穿越回去一样
{\fs10}as if I've deliberately come back to this one day{\r}

1964
01:54:27,980 --> 01:54:29,670
我努力享受每一天
{\fs10}to enjoy it{\r}

1965
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,650
就像它是我这平凡又非凡生命的
{\fs10}as if it was the full final day{\r}

1966
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:34,650
最后一天
{\fs10}of my extraordinary, ordinary life.{\r}

1967
01:54:36,650 --> 01:54:43,650
很多事情不能一次成功
{\fs10}I don't get many things right the first time{\r}

1968
01:54:43,650 --> 01:54:48,650
人们总是对我这样说
{\fs10}In fact, I am told that a lot{\r}

1969
01:54:48,650 --> 01:54:56,650
如今我知道
{\fs10}Now I know all the wrong turns{\r}

1970
01:54:56,650 --> 01:55:00,650
是那些过失带我走到今天
{\fs10}The stumbles and falls brought me here{\r}

1971
01:55:02,930 --> 01:55:04,700
哎呀  你都已经下来啦
{\fs10}Hello, you're down already.{\r}

1972
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:06,640
做得太好了  谢谢喽
{\fs10}That's great. Thank you so much for that.{\r}

1973
01:55:06,770 --> 01:55:08,150
我们坐进来吧
{\fs10}And in we go.{\r}

1974
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:12,150
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}那天之前  我在哪里
{\fs10}And where was I before the day{\r}

1975
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:12,570
波丝  波丝
{\fs10}Posy? Posy!{\r}

1976
01:55:12,150 --> 01:55:17,150
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs12\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}那是第一次见到你美丽的脸
{\fs10}That I first saw your lovely face?{\r}

1977
01:55:17,150 --> 01:55:20,150
如今可以每天相见
{\fs10}Now I see it everyday{\r}

1978
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:21,950
很美味的
{\fs10}That's fine.{\r}

1979
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:32,950
于是我知道
{\fs10}And I know that I am{\r}

1980
01:55:32,950 --> 01:55:42,950
我就是最幸运的人
{\fs10}I am, I am the luckiest{\r}

1981
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:46,270
我们生命的每一天
{\fs10}We're all travelling through time together{\r}

1982
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,730
都是在时间中的旅行
{\fs10}every day of our lives.{\r}

1983
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,320
我们所能做的就是
{\fs10}All we can do is{\r}

1984
01:55:50,330 --> 01:55:51,400
尽我们所能
{\fs10}do our best{\r}

1985
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:54,610
珍惜这段美妙的旅程
{\fs10}to relish this remarkable ride.{\r}

1986
01:56:37,570 --> 01:56:39,490
对对对
{\fs10}Yes, yes, yes...{\r}

1987
01:56:51,790 --> 01:56:53,880
好的  到时候见
{\fs10}Okay, I'll see you then.{\r}

1988
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,420
拜拜啦
{\fs10}Bye-bye.{\r}

1989
01:56:56,090 --> 01:56:57,590
等下见
{\fs10}See you later.{\r}

1990
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:02,870
