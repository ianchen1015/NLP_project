(woman)
Earth-That-Was...

2
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:36,176
could no longer sustain
our numbers, we were so many.

3
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:41,883
We found a new solar system:

4
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:45,155
dozens of planets
and hundreds of moons.

5
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:50,229
Each one terraformed,
a process taking decades...

6
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,462
to support human life.
To be new Earths.

7
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:56,402
The central planets
formed the Alliance.

8
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:58,833
Ruled by an interplanetary
parliament...

9
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:01,375
the Alliance was
a beacon of civilization.

10
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:05,172
The savage outer planets
were not so enlightened...

11
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:07,272
and refused Alliance control.

12
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:10,315
The war was devastating.

13
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,314
But the Alliance's victory
over the Independents...

14
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:15,253
ensured a safer universe.

15
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:17,652
And now, everyone
can enjoy the comfort...

16
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:20,024
and enlightenment
of true civilization.

17
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:23,130
Why were the lndependents
even fighting us?

18
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:25,166
Why wouldn't they look
to be more civilized?

19
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,827
I hear they're cannibals.
That's only Reavers.

20
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:30,030
Reavers aren't real.
Full well they are.

21
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:31,936
I heard they attack settlers
from space...

22
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,440
and kill them,
and wear their skins...

23
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:35,669
and rape them
for hours and hours--

[birds chirping]

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,675
It's true
that there are dangers
on the outer planets.

27
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:44,285
So with so many social
and medical advancements...

28
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:46,446
we can bring
to the lndependents...

29
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:48,352
why would they fight
so hard against us?

30
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:49,515
We meddle.

31
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:51,081
River?

32
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:53,852
People don't like
to be meddled with.

33
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,056
We tell them what to do,
what to think.

34
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:57,723
Don't run, don't walk.

35
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:01,691
We're in their homes
and in their heads
and we haven't the right.

36
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,135
We're meddlesome.

37
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:07,703
River, we're not telling
people what to think...

38
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,538
we're just trying
to show them how.

[screaming]

40
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:14,910
(Dr. Mathias)
She's dreaming. Got that?
Off the charts.

41
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,512
Scary monsters.

42
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:18,610
Let's amp it up.
Delcium, eight drop.

[panting]

44
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:23,116
See, most of our best work
is done when they're asleep.

45
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:25,751
We can monitor and direct
their subconscious...

46
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,522
implant suggestions.

47
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:31,423
It's a little startling
to see at first,
but results are spectacular.

48
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:34,967
Especially in this case.
River Tam is our star pupil.

49
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:36,401
I've heard that.

50
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,370
She'll be ideal
for defense deployment...

51
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,237
even with the side effects.

52
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:41,835
Tell me about them.

53
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,401
Well, obviously,
she's unstable.

54
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:47,277
The neural stripping
does tend to fragment...

55
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:48,907
their own reality matrix.

56
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:51,111
It manifests as borderline--
What use do we have...

57
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:52,881
for a psychic
if she's insane?

58
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:54,854
[groaning]
(Dr. Mathias)
She's not just a psychic.

59
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:57,483
Given the right trigger,
this girl is a living weapon.

60
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:01,154
She has her lucid periods.
We're hoping
to improve upon the....

61
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:04,831
I'm sorry, sir,
but I have to ask.

62
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,391
Is there a reason
for this inspection?

63
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,364
Am I making you nervous?

64
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:12,897
Key members of Parliament
have personally
observed this subject.

65
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,874
I was told that
the Alliance's support...

66
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,410
for the project
was unanimous.

67
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:19,845
The demonstration
of her power--
How is she physically?

68
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:21,676
Like nothing we've seen.

69
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:26,145
All our subjects
are conditioned for combat,
but River...

70
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:30,088
she's a creature
of extraordinary grace.

71
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:32,124
Yes.

72
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:35,354
She always
did love to dance.

73
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,594
River, it's Simon.

Please, it's Simon.

00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,865
It's your brother.

77
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,640
Simon.

78
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:01,747
They know you've come.

[machines beeping]

We can't make it
to the surface from inside.

Backtrack. Stop.

Excuse me...

88
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,828
no one is allowed
in the records room...

89
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:26,669
without my express permission.

90
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,972
Forgive me, but I prefer
to see the event alone,
without...

91
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:32,135
bias.

92
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:35,512
I need to see your clearance.
And you are right
to insist.

00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:42,081
Apologies.

96
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:43,419
An operative of
the Parliament...

97
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:45,857
will, of course,
have full cooperation.

98
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:47,885
I'm not sure what....

99
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:52,360
I see no listing
of rank or name.
I have neither.

100
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:56,532
Like this facility,
I don't exist.

101
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:58,601
Let's talk about the Tams.

102
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:00,904
I assume you've
scanned the status logs--

103
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:04,070
River was your greatest
success. A prodigy.

104
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,343
A phenomenon.

105
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:09,745
Until her brother
walked in here
and took her from you.

106
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:12,647
It's not quite so simple.
I'm well aware of that.

107
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:15,554
There was no way
that I could--
No. No. Of course.

108
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:17,615
The boy spent
his entire fortune
developing...

109
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:19,387
the contacts
to infiltrate this place.

Gave up a brilliant future
in medicine as well.

111
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,327
It's madness.
Madness?

00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,929
Have you looked
at this scan carefully,
Doctor?

At his face?

114
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,839
It's love, in point of fact.

115
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,639
Something a good deal
more dangerous.

116
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:39,871
Why are you here?

117
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:44,578
Because the situation
is even less simple
than you think.

118
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,514
Do you know what your sin is,
Doctor?

119
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:51,655
I wonder if--
It's pride.

120
00:06:57,165 --> 00:07:00,464
Key members of Parliament
have personally
observed this subject.

121
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,263
I was told that
the Alliance's support--

122
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:07,835
"Key members of Parliament."

123
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,139
Key.

124
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:15,379
The minds behind
every military...

125
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,010
diplomatic,
and covert operation...

126
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:20,748
in the galaxy,
and you put them...

127
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:23,256
in a room with a psychic.

128
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:28,624
If there was some
classified information
that she....

129
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,697
She never spoke of it.
I don't know what it is.

130
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:31,823
Nor do l.

131
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,868
And judging by
her deteriorating
mental state...

132
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:35,197
I'd say we're both
better off.

133
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,898
Secrets are not my concern.

134
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:41,073
Keeping them is.

135
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:45,772
Whatever secrets
she might have
accidentally gleaned...

136
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:48,315
it's probable
she doesn't even
know she knows them.

137
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:51,113
That they're buried
beneath layers of psychosis.

138
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:56,087
You know, in certain
older civilized cultures...

when men failed as entirely...

140
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:00,917
as you have,
they would throw themselves...

on their swords.

142
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:04,891
Well, unfortunately,
I forgot to bring a sword.

143
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:10,834
I would put that down
right now, if I were you.

144
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:13,931
Would you be killed
in your sleep
like an ailing pet?

and help her
to come back to us.

162
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,700
I think I may have
a long way to travel.

163
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:29,675
Where are you hiding,
little girl?

164
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:26,364
[explosion]

165
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:27,463
[alarm buzzing]

166
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:30,305
What was that?
Did you see that?

167
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:34,975
Was that the primary
buffer panel?

168
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:37,313
It did seem to resemble--
Did the primary
buffer panel...

169
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:40,354
just fall off my gorramn ship
for no apparent reason?

170
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,314
Looks like.

171
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:44,949
I thought Kaylee checked
the entry couplings.

172
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:47,017
I've a clear memory of it.
If she doesn't get us...

173
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:49,655
extra flow
from the engine room
to offset the burn-through...

174
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,358
this landing is gonna
get pretty interesting.

175
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:54,367
Define "interesting."
"Oh, God,
we're all gonna die?"

176
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:59,062
This is the captain.
We have a little problem...

177
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,233
with our entry sequence,
so we may experience some...

178
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,675
slight turbulence
and then explode.

179
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:05,269
Can you shave the vector?
I'm doing it!

180
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:08,008
It's not enough.
Just get us on the ground!

181
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:10,482
That part will happen
pretty definitely.

182
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:13,786
We're gonna explode?
I don't wanna explode.

183
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:15,447
Jayne, how many weapons
you plan on taking?

184
00:11:15,523 --> 00:11:17,423
You only got two arms.
I just get excitable...

185
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:19,392
as to choice.
Like to have my options open.

186
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,792
I don't plan on any shooting
taking place during this job.

187
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:25,458
What you plan
and what takes place ain't
ever exactly been similar.

188
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,933
No grenades.

189
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:30,263
We crashing again?
(Mal)
Talk to your husband.

190
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:31,566
Mule prepped?
Good to go, sir.

191
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,628
Just loading her up.

192
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:33,731
Those grenades?

193
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,207
(Jayne)
Yeah, Captain
doesn't want them.

194
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,801
Jayne, we're robbing
the place. We're not
occupying it.

195
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:39,274
[crashing]

196
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:43,714
Kaylee!

197
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:50,183
Kaylee, what in the sphincter
of hell are you playing at?

198
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:52,226
We got the primary
buffer panel coming right--

199
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:54,557
Everything's shiny, Captain.
Not to fret.

200
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:58,093
You told me
those entry couplings
would hold for another week!

201
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:02,159
That was six months ago,
Captain.
My ship don't crash.

202
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,665
If she crashes,
you crashed her.

203
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:08,466
Doctor.

204
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,273
Guess who needs
to get innocked
before we hit planet-side.

205
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:14,542
Bit of a rockety ride.

206
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:17,083
Nothing to be worried about.
I'm not worried.

207
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:19,409
Fear is nothing to
be ashamed of, Doctor.

208
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:22,081
This isn't fear.
This is anger.

209
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:27,322
Well, kind of hard to tell
one from the other,
face like yours.

210
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:30,695
Well, I imagine
if it were fear,
my eyes would be wider.

211
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:32,531
I'll keep a lookout
for that next time.

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,897
You're not taking her.

213
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:36,835
No, no, this is not
a thing I'm interested
in talking over with--

214
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:39,202
She's not going with you,
and that's final.

215
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:42,242
I hear the words
"that's final" come
out your mouth ever again...

216
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,777
they truly will be.

217
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:47,909
This boat is my home.
You all are guests on it.

218
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:49,543
Guests?

219
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:52,149
Now, I earned my passage,
Captain--
(Mal)
And it's time...

220
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,017
your little sister learned
from your example.

221
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:56,318
I have earned my passage...

222
00:12:56,891 --> 00:13:00,224
treating bullet holes,
knife wounds, laser burns.

223
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:02,057
Some jobs are more
interesting than others.

224
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,098
And you want to put my sister
in the middle of that.

225
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:06,326
Didn't say "want."
Said "will."

226
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:08,062
It's one job, Doc.
She'll be fine.

227
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:10,696
She's a 17-year-old girl.

228
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:13,667
A mentally
traumatized 17--
She's a reader.

229
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:16,076
Sees into the truth
of things.

230
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:18,874
Might see trouble
before it's coming.
Which is of use to me.

231
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:22,313
And that's your guiding star,
isn't it? What's of use.

232
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:26,375
Honestly, Doctor,
I think we may really
crash this time anyway.

233
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:28,779
Do you understand
what I have gone through...

234
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,289
to keep River away
from the Alliance?

235
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:32,918
I do, and it's a fact
we here have been courteous...

236
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:34,552
enough to keep
to our own selves.

237
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:37,757
Are you threatening to--
I look out for me and mine.

238
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:41,698
That don't include you
less I conjure it does.

239
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,932
You stuck a thorn
in the Alliance's paw.
That tickles me a bit.

240
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,804
But it also means
I got to step
twice as fast to avoid them...

241
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,343
and that means
turning down plenty of jobs.

242
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:51,776
Even honest ones.

243
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:54,477
Put this crew together with
the promise of work...

244
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:56,744
[metal clanking]
which the Alliance makes
harder every year.

245
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:59,048
Come a day there
won't be room
for naughty men like us...

246
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,644
to slip about at all.

247
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:03,916
This job goes south,
there well may not be another.

248
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:07,390
So here is us,
on the raggedy edge.

249
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,958
Don't push me,
and I won't push you.

250
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:14,163
[speaking Chinese]

251
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:30,205
Zoe, Wash gonna straighten
this boat out before
we get flattened?

252
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:33,811
(Zoe)
Like a downy feather, sir.
No one flies like my mister.

253
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:35,853
[engine grinding]

254
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:38,984
[Mal and Zoe chattering]

255
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:43,986
(Simon)
River.

256
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:48,265
I know.
We're going for a ride.

257
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:52,303
[engine revving]

258
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,276
[people chattering]

259
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:09,680
Hey, little one.

260
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:13,253
Understand your part
in all this?

261
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:16,654
Do you?

262
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,196
This is what I do, darling.

263
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,270
This is what I do.

264
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,241
(Mal)
Let's move, people.

265
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:33,013
Quit fiddling.
Want the boat running
smooth when we get back.

266
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,708
Have faith, Captain.
Not today.

267
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:38,618
Pair of clips
in the rear hatch.

268
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:42,448
We should hit town
right during Sunday worship.

269
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:43,854
Won't be any crowds.

270
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:46,223
If Fanty and Mingo
are right about the payroll...

271
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:48,353
this could look to be
a sunny day for us.

272
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,329
(Simon)
River, stay behind the others.

273
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:53,424
If there's fighting,
drop to the floor or run away.

274
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:56,459
It's okay
to leave them to die.

275
00:15:56,771 --> 00:16:00,263
Doctor, I'm taking your sister
under my protection here.

276
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:02,837
If anything happens to her,
anything at all...

277
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,811
I swear to you
I will get very choked up.

278
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,871
Honestly.
There could be tears.

279
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:20,722
Don't mind
the Captain none, Simon.
I know he'll look out for her.

280
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:23,557
They'll be back
before you can spit.

281
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,702
Well, not that you spit.

282
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:35,904
(Jayne)
What are we hoping
to find here...

283
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:37,410
that equals
the worth of a turd?

284
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:40,311
(Mal)
Security payroll. Alliance
don't have the manpower...

285
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:42,975
to "enforce the peace"
on every outer-rim planet.

286
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,315
They hire
out to the private firms,
who will not work for credit.

287
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:49,823
They get paid in cashy money,
which once a month rests here.

288
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,915
Don't that lead back to
the Alliance, anyhow?

289
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:54,860
No private firm
would ever report the theft
of their own payroll.

290
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:58,092
They'd appear weak,
might lose their contract.

291
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:01,794
Yeah, we're as ghosts in this.
Won't but rattle the floor.

292
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:06,033
Shiny. Let's be bad guys.

293
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,166
Hands and knees and heads
bowed down! Everybody, down!

294
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:10,403
[woman screaming]

295
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,468
[grunting]

296
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:20,945
Looks like this is the place.

297
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:24,716
You all wanna
be looking very intently
at your own belly buttons.

298
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:28,056
I see a head start to rise,
violence is going to ensue.

299
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,157
Probably guessed we mean
to be thieving here...

300
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:33,393
but what we're after
is not yours.

301
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:36,126
So let's have
no undue fussing.

302
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:38,202
She's locked up.

303
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,747
[people murmuring]

304
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:27,453
Do you know what
the definition of a hero is?

305
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:30,350
Someone who gets
other people killed.

306
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:32,387
You can look it up later.

307
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:37,563
Big happy family.

308
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:43,926
[beeping]

309
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:50,466
At last.
We can retire and give up
this life of crime.

310
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:56,680
[metal rattling]

311
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:58,040
Hey!

312
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:02,520
You all are Browncoats, eh?
Fought for independence?

313
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,649
Petty thieving
ain't exactly soldiers' work.

314
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:09,025
War's long done.
We're all just folk now.
Listen up!

315
00:19:09,764 --> 00:19:11,459
We are coming down
to empty that vault!

316
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:14,399
(guard)
You have to give me
your authorization password!

317
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:19,530
(guard)
Okay.

318
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,787
I'm telling you I heard it.
Repeater.

319
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:40,125
Did sound somewhat
like gun blast. Maybe
you ought run tell Lawman.

320
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:41,950
[screaming]

321
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,592
What the hell is up?
You all right?

322
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,061
What's going on?

323
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:50,763
Reavers.

324
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:01,107
The leg is good. It'll bleed
plenty and we avoid
any necessary organs.

325
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:02,547
I was thinking
more of a graze.

326
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,447
No, you don't want it
to look like you gave up.

327
00:20:04,518 --> 00:20:05,712
No, I get that.

328
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:07,151
(Jayne)
Mal!

329
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:09,518
Every heist, he's got
to start yelling my name.

330
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,457
Mal! Reavers!

331
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:15,421
The girl's pitching a fit.
They're here
or they're coming soon.

332
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:16,895
Get on the Mule.

333
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:19,762
Does that lock
from the inside?
Yes.

334
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:22,325
Get everyone upstairs.
You get them down here
and you seal it.

335
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:24,963
As long as you got air
you don't open up,
you understand?

336
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,133
Get them inside the vault!

337
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,367
You see them?
Zoe, take the wheel!

338
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:32,810
(Jayne)
Anybody see them?

339
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:40,514
Take me with you!

340
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:42,249
Get back in the vault with
the others.

341
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:45,258
I can't stay here! Please!
It's too many. Move ahead.

342
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:46,759
Please!

343
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:54,526
[screaming]

344
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,207
[engine revving]

345
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:23,819
Faster! Faster!
Faster would be better!

346
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:34,468
How come
they ain't blowing us
out the air?

347
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:37,409
They wanna run us down.
The up-close kill.

348
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:41,241
They want us alive
when they eat us.

349
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:45,675
Boy, sure would be nice
if we had some grenades,
don't you think?

350
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,116
[gun firing]

351
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:50,349
Wash, baby, can you hear me?
We're moments from air.

352
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:52,722
You got somebody
behind you?
Reavers.

353
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:56,053
Kaylee!

354
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,927
Heat her up. We got Reavers.

355
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:05,062
We're not gonna
get to you in time.
Keep moving, honey.

356
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:06,731
We're coming to you.

357
00:22:14,248 --> 00:22:16,443
(Jayne)
Where's my clips?
(Mal)
Rear hatch.

358
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:17,906
[screaming]

359
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:26,819

[Jayne yelling]

361
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:33,431
I won't get ate!

362
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:39,172
You shoot me if they take me!
Well, don't shoot me first!

363
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,051
[grunting]

364
00:22:57,992 --> 00:22:59,983
Get some distance on them.

365
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,858
You come to the flats,
I want you to swing round.

366
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,164
We're gonna try
a Barn Swallow.

367
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:07,166
Simon! Open her up!

368
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:13,773
(Mal)
They're closing on us!

369
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:16,036
Those rocks,
give them a taste.

370
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,991
(Wash)
Okay, baby,
we talked this through.

371
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:38,855
Talking ain't doing.

372
00:23:38,932 --> 00:23:40,024
[speaking Chinese]

373
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:42,024

[groaning]

376
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:22,609
River?
I swallowed a bug.

377
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:30,573
Are you okay?
Is he okay?

378
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:31,640
[screeching]

379
00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:46,263
(Wash)
We all here? What's going on?

380
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:47,864
Hello?

381
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,632
No casualties.

382
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:54,430
Anybody following?
(Wash)
Nice flying, baby.

383
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:56,942
That's a negative.
Clean getaway.

384
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:01,678
Set course for Beaumonde.
First thing,
I want this body--

385
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:02,738
(Kaylee)
Simon!

386
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,612
[speaking Chinese]

387
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:07,516
You son of a whore.
I'm a hair's breadth...

388
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:08,919
from riddling
you with holes, Doctor.

389
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:12,447
One simple job!
She'll be fine!
She is fine!

390
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:14,653
Except for being still crazy,
she's a picture of health!

391
00:25:14,728 --> 00:25:18,425
Wasn't for River,
we'd probably be left there.
She felt them coming.

392
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,692
(Simon)
Never again.
You understand me?

393
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:23,566
Seems I remember a talk about
you giving orders on my boat.

394
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:25,195
Well, we're off your boat.

395
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:27,740
Just as soon as River
gets her share of the bounty.

396
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,572
Let's not do anything hasty--
No, shiny!

397
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:32,436
We'll be on Beaumonde
in 10 hours' time...

398
00:25:32,513 --> 00:25:35,380
you can pick up your earnings
and be on your merry.

399
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:38,482
Meantime, you do your job.

400
00:25:39,386 --> 00:25:40,944
Patch up my crew.

401
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,917
He didn't lie down.

402
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:48,354
They never lie down.

403
00:25:57,137 --> 00:25:59,537
(Zoe)
No, I think things will glide
a deal smoother for us...

404
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:01,574
without River
and Simon on board...

405
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:03,041
but how long
do you think they'll last?

406
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,668
Doc made his call.

407
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:05,734
Yeah.

408
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:07,644
They's as babes in a basket
when we took them in.

409
00:26:07,714 --> 00:26:09,545
We sheltered them plenty.

410
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:12,949
Man has to cut loose,
learn to stand on his own.

411
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,619
Like that man back in town?

412
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:21,025
I had to shoot him.

413
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:23,085
What Reavers would've done
before they killed him--

414
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:25,654
I know.
That was a piece of mercy.

415
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,469
But before that,
him begging us
to bring him along.

416
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:33,572
We couldn't take the weight.
Would've slowed us down.

417
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,905
You know that for certain?
Mule won't run with five.

418
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:41,309
I should've dumped the girl?
Or you? Or Jayne?

419
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:42,778
Oh, Jayne....

420
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,548
You could've
tossed the payload.
Tossed the....

421
00:26:47,754 --> 00:26:51,520
Zoe, I got bits falling
off my ship, I got
a crew ain't been paid...

422
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:54,561
and, oh, yeah, a powerful need
to eat sometime this month.

423
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:56,690
We tell Fanty and Mingo
we skunked the job...

424
00:26:56,763 --> 00:26:58,754
what do think
they'll do to us?

425
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:02,534
We're close to gone out here.

426
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:06,138
We get a job,
we got to make good.

427
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:09,335
Sir, I don't disagree
on any particular point.

428
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:12,271
It's just...

429
00:27:15,449 --> 00:27:18,680
in the time of war,
we would've never
left a man stranded.

430
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:21,816
Maybe that's why we lost.

431
00:27:31,198 --> 00:27:32,859
That was close.

432
00:27:35,202 --> 00:27:36,567
(Jayne)
I do not get it.

433
00:27:37,437 --> 00:27:39,234
How's a guy get so wrong?

434
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:42,797
Cutting on his own face,
raping and murdering.

435
00:27:45,712 --> 00:27:47,703
I'll kill a man
in a fair fight...

436
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:51,040
or if I think
he's gonna
start a fair fight...

437
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:55,412
or if he bothers me,
or if there's a woman...

438
00:27:55,856 --> 00:28:00,691
or if I'm getting paid.
Mostly only when
I'm getting paid.

439
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:04,558
These Reavers,
the last 10 years...

440
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:07,464
they show up like
the boogeyman from stories.

441
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:11,767
Eating people alive?
Where does that get fun?

442
00:28:13,373 --> 00:28:15,705
Shepherd Book said
they was men who just...

443
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:19,143
reached the edge of space,
saw a vasty nothingness...

444
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:21,203
and went
bibbledy over it.

445
00:28:21,348 --> 00:28:22,337
Oh, hell.

446
00:28:24,117 --> 00:28:25,675
I've been to the edge.

447
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:30,254
Just looked like more space.

448
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:32,657
I don't know.

449
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:35,092
It can get awful lonely
in the black.

450
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:39,855
Like to get addlepated
ourselves, we stay
on this boat much longer.

451
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:43,125
Captain will drive
us all off, one by one.

452
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,761
Just like Simon and River.

453
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:49,008
Just like lnara.

454
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:53,144
Kaylee, are you ever going
to put that capture down?

455
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:55,771
(Kaylee)
We got to have records
of everything, Inara.

456
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:59,717
A bona fide companion
entertained clients
on this very ship.

457
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:03,620
In this very bed.
Well, I can't do my work here.

458
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,715
And I don't think
the Captain approves.

459
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:07,384
The Captain
wants you to stay--

460
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:10,828
That man doesn't
know what he wants.
I don't have time to....

กำกำ[music playing]

[people chattering]

463
00:29:44,998 --> 00:29:47,523
(woman)
Don't talk to the barkers,
talk to the captains.

464
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:51,002
You look the captain
in the eye.
Know who you're dealing with.

465
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:53,095
I wish there was....

466
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,771
You shouldn't
ought to be so clean.

467
00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:02,704
It's a dead giveaway
you don't belong,
you always got to be tidy.

468
00:30:02,783 --> 00:30:04,717
Don't pay anybody in advance.

469
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:08,877
And don't ride in anything
with a Capissen 38 engine...

00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:10,946

out of the sky.

Kaylee.

472
00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:26,599
River, do you want
to stay with them?

473
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:29,799
It isn't safe.

474
00:30:31,545 --> 00:30:32,534
No.

475
00:30:34,848 --> 00:30:36,941
I fear it isn't safe anymore.

476
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:40,647
For them.

the train station vault.

480
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,502
Kaylee,
this is a place of business.
We can talk about Simon when--

481
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,047
When he's
four worlds away?

482
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:10,447
Or the Alliance gets a hold
of him and River?

483
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:11,575
(Mal)
That ain't my worry.

484
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:13,949
I got to finish this job
and get us another one.

485
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,851
Can't do that
carrying those two.

486
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:18,156
(Kaylee)
How can you be so cold?

487
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:20,386
Captain didn't
make them fugitives.

488
00:31:20,494 --> 00:31:22,655
But he could
have made them family.

489
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:25,627
Instead of keeping Simon
from seeing I was there.

490
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:29,267
When I carried such a torch,
when we could've....

491
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:32,669
We're going on a year now,
I ain't had nothing
twixt my nethers...

493
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:36,604
Oh, God! I can't know that!

494
00:31:36,843 --> 00:31:38,834
I could stand
to hear a little more.

495
00:31:39,513 --> 00:31:41,174
If you had a care
for anybody's heart--

496
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:42,875
You knew
he was gonna leave.

497
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:44,746
We never been
but a way station
to those two.

498
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:46,445
And how do you know
what he feels?

499
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,489
He's got River to worry on
but he still could've
shown you....

500
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:51,820
If I truly wanted
someone bad enough...

501
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:55,487
wouldn't be a thing
in the 'verse could stop
me from going to her.

502
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:57,657
Tell that to lnara.

Domestic troubles?

'Cause we don't
wanna interrupt.

506
00:32:09,476 --> 00:32:11,637
A man should keep
his house in order.

He's Mingo.
He's Fanty.
You're Mingo.

509
00:32:16,816 --> 00:32:19,876
How is it you always know?
Fanty's prettier.

512
00:32:38,271 --> 00:32:39,932
(Mingo)
Quite a crew you've got.

513
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:42,098
Yeah, they're
a fine bunch of reubens.

514
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:44,575
How you keep them
on that crap boat,
is the subject...

515
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:46,441
of much musing
between me and Fanty.

516
00:32:46,513 --> 00:32:48,845
We go on and on.
So I'm noticing.

517
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:52,044
Is there a problem
we don't know of?

we can talk about
the next job?

Well, our end is 40,
precious.

You're unpredictable, Mal.

does that work anyhow?

behavioral conditioning.

what that something might be?

And you never did ask.

she could go monkeyshit...

Or the weapon?

she was getting better.

00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:27,343
And I thought
they was getting off!

586

Didn't we have an intricate
plan how they was gonna
be not here anymore?

her tea and dumplings.

why'd you bring her back on?

Can I make a suggestion
that doesn't involve

to learn. Is there
any follow up, a newswave?

604
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:02,744
There is no news.
There's the truth
of the signal.

the puppet theater...

on the somnambulant public.

00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:13,692
Well, what about this?
Did this make
the puppet theater?

608
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,055
No, sir.
And no lawforce flags, either.

609
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:18,063
I had to go into
the security feed direct.

610
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:21,032
You can do that?
Can't stop the signal, Mal.

Everything goes somewhere,
and I go everywhere.

612
00:40:24,737 --> 00:40:26,705
Security feeds
are a traipse to access...

613
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:28,434
and I wasn't the first one in.

614
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:31,807
This has prints on it.
So somebody else
has been fed this.

stop falling in love with me.

embarrass yourself.

I have a commitment
to my Lovebot.

618
00:40:42,822 --> 00:40:46,724
It was a very beautiful
ceremony. Lenore wrote
her own vows...

619
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:50,755
I cried like a baby,
a hungry, angry baby.

620
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:57,666
And she falls asleep.
Which, she would be sleepy.

621
00:40:58,037 --> 00:40:59,129
Can you go back?

622
00:40:59,205 --> 00:41:01,070
See if anybody spoke with her
before she acted up.

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,267
Made any kind
of contact with her.

624
00:41:04,844 --> 00:41:06,175
กำกำ[music playing]

625
00:41:06,245 --> 00:41:08,543
Miranda.
"Miranda"?

626
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:12,884
Go back further.

627
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:14,375
No.

628
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:17,878
(Mal)
Please.

629
00:41:22,328 --> 00:41:25,456
Mal, you're very smart.

630
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:29,131
Someone is talking to her.
The oaty bar?

631
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:33,332
Subliminal.

632
00:41:34,373 --> 00:41:37,035
It's a subliminal message,
broadwaved to trigger her.

633
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,477
I've been seeing this code
pop up all over,
the last few weeks.

634
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:43,438
It's Alliance
and it's high military.

635
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:48,911
They have gone
to enormous trouble
to find your little friend.

636
00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:51,824
And found her, they have.

637
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,850
Do you all know
what it is you're carrying?

638
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:05,193
They're afraid of me.

639
00:42:06,572 --> 00:42:09,632
I'm sorry.
They should be.

640
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:14,369
But I'll show them. Oh, God.

641
00:42:15,882 --> 00:42:18,976
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

642
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,514
Show me off like a dog.

643
00:42:23,723 --> 00:42:25,213
Old men covered in blood.

644
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:28,089
It never touched them,
but they're drowning in it.

645
00:42:29,662 --> 00:42:32,927
I don't know what I'm saying.
I never know what I'm saying.

646
00:42:36,068 --> 00:42:38,332
In the Maidenhead,
you said something.

647
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:41,670
When you were triggered,
do you remember?

648
00:42:41,741 --> 00:42:44,369
The Captain saw you
say something on the feed.

649
00:42:46,112 --> 00:42:47,409
Miranda.

650
00:42:49,015 --> 00:42:50,004
Miranda.

651
00:42:51,918 --> 00:42:53,579
Ask her.

652
00:42:55,655 --> 00:42:57,418
Who is Miranda?

653
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:04,928
Am I talking to Miranda now?

654
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:08,856
No.

655
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:11,828
Not right.

656
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:18,666
But I think
when they triggered you...

657
00:43:19,512 --> 00:43:21,480
it somehow brought this up.

658
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:24,107
This memory.
It isn't mine.

659
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,111
The memory, it isn't mine.

660
00:43:26,185 --> 00:43:29,086
And I shouldn't have
to carry it. It isn't mine.

661
00:43:29,388 --> 00:43:31,754
Don't make me sleep again.
I won't.

662
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:33,614
I won't.

663
00:43:34,393 --> 00:43:35,917
Put a bullet to me.

664
00:43:36,963 --> 00:43:39,557
Bullet in the brainpan,
squish.

665
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:44,297
Don't say that. Not ever.

666
00:43:46,906 --> 00:43:48,567
We'll get through this.

667
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,106
Things are going to get
much, much worse.

668
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,951
[birds chirping]

669
00:44:02,154 --> 00:44:03,485
[water running]

670
00:44:48,134 --> 00:44:50,432
(Mal)
Thanks for taking us in again,
Shepherd.

671
00:44:51,137 --> 00:44:52,434
(Shepherd)
You got a plan?

672
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:54,537
Hiding ain't a plan?

673
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:56,268
It'll do you for a spell.

674
00:44:56,342 --> 00:44:58,469
And the folks
here'll be glad
of the extra coin.

675
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:00,569
But the Alliance
will be coming.

676
00:45:00,813 --> 00:45:03,373
They're after this girl
with a powerful will.

677
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:07,017
I look to hear the tromp
of their boots any moment.

678
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,480
[bird hooting]

679
00:45:09,455 --> 00:45:10,786
You won't.

680
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:15,855
This isn't
a palms-up military run, Mal.

681
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,059
No reports broadwaved...

682
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:20,959
no warrants.

683
00:45:21,434 --> 00:45:23,834
Much as they want her,
they want her hid.

684
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:26,337
That means closed file.

685
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:28,706
Means an operative.

686
00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:31,802
Which is trouble
you've not known.

687
00:45:34,246 --> 00:45:36,111
I could have left her there.

688
00:45:38,484 --> 00:45:39,712
I had an out.

689
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:42,646
Hell, I had every reason
in the 'verse...

690
00:45:42,722 --> 00:45:44,883
to leave her lay
and haul anchor.

691
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,586
It's not your way, Mal.

692
00:45:49,061 --> 00:45:50,358
I have a way?

693
00:45:51,397 --> 00:45:53,092
That better than a plan?

694
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:56,897
Only one thing is gonna
walk you through this, Mal.

695
00:45:58,871 --> 00:45:59,860
Belief.

696
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:04,002
You know I always look
to you for counsel...

697
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:06,271
but sermons make me
sleepy, Shepherd.

698
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:09,311
I ain't looking for help
from on high.

699
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:12,779
That's a long wait
for a train don't come.

700
00:46:12,852 --> 00:46:16,811
When I talk about belief,
why do you always assume
I'm talking about God?

701
00:46:22,762 --> 00:46:24,957
They'll come at you sideways.

702
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:28,199
It's how they think.
It's how they move.

703
00:46:29,402 --> 00:46:33,202
Sidle up and smile.
Hit you where you're weak.

704
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,775
Sort of man
they're like to send
believes hard.

705
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:41,003
Kills and never asks why.

706
00:46:46,085 --> 00:46:48,952
It's of interest to me
how much you seem
to know about that world.

707
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:51,148
I wasn't born
a Shepherd, Mal.

708
00:46:51,223 --> 00:46:53,487
Have to tell me
about that sometime.

709
00:46:53,626 --> 00:46:54,615
[sighing]

710
00:46:55,361 --> 00:46:56,885
No, I don't.

711
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:01,893
(woman)
River?

712
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:02,991
[birds chirping]

713
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:04,730
River, you look tired.

714
00:47:05,037 --> 00:47:08,803
I think everybody's
a little tired by now.
Why don't we all lie down.

715
00:47:09,842 --> 00:47:12,811
A little peace and quiet
will make everything better.

716
00:47:12,978 --> 00:47:15,538
River. Do as you're told.
No.

717
00:47:15,614 --> 00:47:18,208
It's going to be fine.
Lie down.
No.

718
00:47:22,588 --> 00:47:23,850
(man)
Cut them down.

719
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,492
What?
(Wash)
Mal! You up?

720
00:47:31,363 --> 00:47:33,991
I got a wave. I'm gonna
bounce it down to you.

721
00:47:39,438 --> 00:47:40,427
Inara.

722
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:44,240
I.... Is this a bad time?

723
00:47:45,144 --> 00:47:46,270
No, this...

724
00:47:46,846 --> 00:47:48,006
good as any.

725
00:47:48,514 --> 00:47:51,244
How's your world?
Cold. It's autumn here.

726
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,581
Still at the Training House?

727
00:47:55,054 --> 00:47:56,043
[clearing throat]

728
00:47:57,556 --> 00:48:01,686
So, what occasions the wave?
Not that to see you ain't....

729
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:06,656
Well, you look very fine.
Oh. Thank you.

730
00:48:07,032 --> 00:48:08,829
(Mal)
So, what was the....

731
00:48:11,303 --> 00:48:14,568
I guess we're having
something of a problem
here with the locals.

732
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,234
And, I thought maybe--
You could use a gun hand?

733
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:21,473
I'm hoping not.
But if you happen
to be close at all, you....

734
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:25,607
The crew could take
your ease here for a while.
And there'd be payment.

735
00:48:28,254 --> 00:48:31,485
Well, it would be....
I mean, I'd like to.

736
00:48:35,794 --> 00:48:38,354
Kaylee's been missing you
something fierce.

737
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,091
(all)
Oh, man.
I miss her, too.

738
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,259
I even miss
my shuttle, occasionally.

739
00:48:42,334 --> 00:48:44,427
Yeah, you left, um....

740
00:48:44,803 --> 00:48:46,532
Got some of your
stuff in a trunk.

741
00:48:46,605 --> 00:48:48,129
I never did get a chance
to drop it off.

742
00:48:48,207 --> 00:48:52,473
I didn't mean to leave stuff.
I didn't look
through the stuff.

743
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:56,008
I just....
Just sundries I expect.

744
00:48:58,918 --> 00:49:01,716
So I'll send you a wave,
soon as I can.

745
00:49:02,454 --> 00:49:03,614
Thank you.

746
00:49:12,565 --> 00:49:15,432
Inara, nice to see
her again.

747
00:49:17,403 --> 00:49:19,769
So, trap?
Trap.

748
00:49:20,306 --> 00:49:22,968
We going in?
Only but a few hours out.

749
00:49:23,576 --> 00:49:26,568
Yeah, but, remember the part
where it's a trap?

750
00:49:26,779 --> 00:49:29,213
If that's the case,
then lnara's already
caught in it.

751
00:49:29,281 --> 00:49:31,272
She wouldn't
set us up willing.

752
00:49:31,517 --> 00:49:34,384
Might be we got a shot
at seeing who's
turning these wheels.

753
00:49:34,453 --> 00:49:35,477
We go in.

754
00:49:35,554 --> 00:49:38,887
But how can you be sure
lnara don't just
wanna see you?

755
00:49:39,825 --> 00:49:42,225
Sometimes people
have feelings.

756
00:49:42,394 --> 00:49:44,419
I'm referring here to people.

757
00:49:46,198 --> 00:49:48,291
You all were watching,
I take it.

758
00:49:50,236 --> 00:49:51,965
Yes.
Did you see us fight?

759
00:49:52,204 --> 00:49:53,762
No.
Trap.

760
00:50:01,747 --> 00:50:05,581
We're about 70 miles
from the Training House,
and nobody on radar.

761
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,119
If the Alliance is about,
they're laying low.

762
00:50:08,187 --> 00:50:09,347
They're about.

763
00:50:09,421 --> 00:50:11,446
Find us a home.
I'll take the shuttle
a little closer.

764
00:50:11,523 --> 00:50:13,184
Zoe, ship is yours.

765
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:15,784
Remember. If anything
happens to me...

766
00:50:15,861 --> 00:50:17,590
or if you don't hear from me
within the hour...

767
00:50:17,663 --> 00:50:19,927
you take this ship
and you come
and you rescue me.

768
00:50:19,999 --> 00:50:20,988
What?

769
00:50:21,634 --> 00:50:23,932
Risk my ship?
I mean it.

770
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:27,100
It's cold out there.
And I don't wanna get left.

771
00:50:43,956 --> 00:50:47,323
Dear Buddha,
please bring me a pony,
and a plastic rocket, and--

772
00:50:47,393 --> 00:50:49,293
Mal! What are you
doing here?

773
00:50:49,895 --> 00:50:51,089
Well, you invited me.

774
00:50:51,163 --> 00:50:53,723
I never thought for a second
you'd be stupid enough
to come.

775
00:50:53,799 --> 00:50:55,664
Well, that makes you
kind of a tease, doesn't it?

776
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:57,668
You knew my invitation
wasn't on the level.

777
00:50:57,736 --> 00:51:00,705
Which led me to conclude
that you must be
in some trouble.

778
00:51:00,773 --> 00:51:02,536
I'm fine. I'm giddy.

779
00:51:02,608 --> 00:51:05,042
For a woman schooled
in telling a man
what he wants to hear...

780
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:08,602
you ain't much of a liar.
Mal, you cannot
handle this man.

781
00:51:14,687 --> 00:51:15,847
I have to say, Captain...

782
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:18,788
I'm impressed that you
would come for her yourself.

783
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:22,218
And that you would make it
this far, in that outfit.

784
00:51:23,395 --> 00:51:25,693
I can be very graceful
when I need to.

785
00:51:25,764 --> 00:51:27,129
I've no doubt.

786
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:31,230
What are you doing?
I'm praying for you, Mal.

787
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:33,733
She's very thoughtful.

788
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:37,142
But I mean it when I say
I've no intent to harm you.

789
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,537
Speak your piece.

790
00:51:40,012 --> 00:51:41,877
I think you're
beginning to understand...

791
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:43,915
how dangerous River Tam is.

792
00:51:44,283 --> 00:51:46,080
She is a mite unpredictable.

793
00:51:46,352 --> 00:51:48,252
Mood swings, of a sort.

794
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,845
It's worse than you know.
It usually is.

795
00:51:50,923 --> 00:51:54,552
That girl will
rain destruction down
on you and your ship.

796
00:51:55,961 --> 00:51:58,725
She is an albatross, Captain.

797
00:51:58,897 --> 00:52:00,626
Way I remember it...

798
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:04,066
albatross was
a ship's good luck,
till some idiot killed it.

799
00:52:04,603 --> 00:52:07,299
Yes, I've read a poem.
Try not to faint.

800
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,671
I've seen your war record.

801
00:52:10,642 --> 00:52:13,202
I know how you must feel about
the Alliance.

802
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:15,674
You really don't.
Fair to say.

803
00:52:16,415 --> 00:52:19,248
But I have to hope
you understand,
you can't beat us.

804
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:21,047
I got no need to beat you.

805
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,987
I just want to go my way.
And you can do that...

806
00:52:24,823 --> 00:52:27,849
once you let me take
River Tam back home.

807
00:52:31,563 --> 00:52:34,088
No, no. You're working
this deal all crabbed.

808
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:36,895
You got to open with payment.
That is a trap.

809
00:52:37,035 --> 00:52:40,596
I offer money,
you'll play the man of honor
and take umbrage.

810
00:52:40,806 --> 00:52:43,434
I ask you to do what is right,
you'll play the brigand.

811
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:46,034
I have no stomach for games.

812
00:52:46,545 --> 00:52:48,536
I already know
you will not see reason.

813
00:52:48,614 --> 00:52:50,172
The Alliance wanted to
show me a reason...

814
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:52,444
they shouldn't have sent
an assassin.

815
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,784
I have a warship
in deep orbit, Captain.

816
00:53:02,461 --> 00:53:05,988
We locked on
to Serenity's pulse beacon
the moment you hit atmo.

817
00:53:06,131 --> 00:53:08,156
I can speak a word
and send a missile...

818
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:10,929
to that exact location
inside of three minutes.

819
00:53:11,003 --> 00:53:12,163
You do that...

820
00:53:13,272 --> 00:53:16,139
you'd best make peace
with your dear
and fluffy lord.

821
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:21,140
Pulse beacon.

822
00:53:21,413 --> 00:53:25,372
Advice from an old tracker.
You want to find someone,
use your eyes.

823
00:53:25,918 --> 00:53:28,182
How long do you think
you can really run from us?

824
00:53:28,253 --> 00:53:30,881
I never credited
the Alliance with
an overabundance of brains.

825
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:33,117
And if you're
the best they got--
Captain Reynolds...

826
00:53:33,192 --> 00:53:35,990
I should tell you,
so that you don't
waste your time...

827
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:40,020
you can't make me angry.
Please, spend
an hour with him.

828
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:43,563
I want to resolve this
like civilized men.

829
00:53:44,636 --> 00:53:46,536
I'm not threatening you.

830
00:53:46,905 --> 00:53:48,372
I'm unarmed.
Good.

831
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,634
[gun firing]

832
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:55,538
I am, of course,
wearing full body armor.

833
00:53:55,614 --> 00:53:57,946
I am not a moron.
(lnara)
Wait, just let--

834

What, no backup?

841
00:54:28,146 --> 00:54:31,343
Making an awful ruckus.
They'll come
when they're needed.

842
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:32,849
I'd start whistling.

843
00:54:32,985 --> 00:54:36,148
Captain, what do you think
is going to happen here?

844
00:54:38,957 --> 00:54:40,584
[both grunting]

Nothing here is what it seems.
He isn't the plucky hero.

850
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:32,099
The Alliance isn't
some evil empire.
This is not the grand arena.

851
00:55:32,344 --> 00:55:33,971
And that's not incense.

852
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,574
[beeping]

853
00:55:40,986 --> 00:55:42,180
Sir, can you hear me?

854
00:55:42,254 --> 00:55:44,779
Just a flash bomb. Go. Go!

855
00:55:45,457 --> 00:55:47,584
[lnara and Mal grunting]

856
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:53,726
What have you done
to my shuttle?
It's not your shuttle.

857
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:55,964
Head east. Keep her low.

858
00:55:56,134 --> 00:55:57,726
[engine revving]

859
00:56:11,817 --> 00:56:13,614
Okay, forget
the pulse beacon.

860
00:56:13,685 --> 00:56:15,846
There must be another way
to track the ship.

861
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:17,320
Get a read
on the nav. sat.

862
00:56:17,389 --> 00:56:19,949
It's a registered transport,
you must be able to locate.

863
00:56:20,025 --> 00:56:21,014
(ensign)
Sir?

864
00:56:21,093 --> 00:56:22,958
Yes, have you found
a nav. sat. trajectory?

865
00:56:23,028 --> 00:56:25,462
Sir, we found seven.

866
00:56:33,205 --> 00:56:34,934
(Inara)
We've every reason
to be afraid.

867
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,332
Why, 'cause this guy
beat up Mal?
That ain't so hard.

868
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,935
He didn't beat me up.
Nobody said that.

869
00:56:41,013 --> 00:56:42,776
Because he's a believer.

870
00:56:43,015 --> 00:56:47,452
He's intelligent, methodical,
and devout in his belief...

871
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:49,919
that killing River
is the right thing to do.

872
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:52,548
So no hope
of a reward, huh?

873
00:56:53,492 --> 00:56:56,928
Did he say anything
about a Miranda?

874
00:56:57,729 --> 00:56:58,787
What is that?

875
00:56:58,864 --> 00:57:01,264
Don't know who or what,
but it's on River's mind.

876
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:03,324
Conjure it might be the reason
they're after her.

877
00:57:03,402 --> 00:57:06,303
You think maybe it poses
some kind of threat
to the Alliance?

878
00:57:06,371 --> 00:57:07,736
Do we care?

879
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,835
Are we caring about that?

880
00:57:09,908 --> 00:57:12,570
You dumb-ass hogs,
the only people
she's a threat to is...

881
00:57:12,644 --> 00:57:14,134
us on this boat.

882
00:57:14,212 --> 00:57:16,043
Look, we get back
to Haven...

883
00:57:16,114 --> 00:57:17,138
in a few
hours' time.
Oh, yeah.

884
00:57:17,215 --> 00:57:18,512
Hiding under
the Shepherd's skirts...

885
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:19,607
that's a manful scheme.

886
00:57:19,685 --> 00:57:21,710
You wanna run this ship?
Yes.

887
00:57:22,788 --> 00:57:24,585
Well, you can't.

888
00:57:25,323 --> 00:57:27,518
Do a damn sight
better job than you.

889

Getting us lashed over
a couple of strays.

890
00:57:30,295 --> 00:57:32,286
No offense, Doc.
I think it's
noble as a grape...

891
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:33,592
the way you look to River.

892
00:57:33,665 --> 00:57:36,133
But she ain't my sister
and she ain't your crew.

893
00:57:36,201 --> 00:57:38,567
Oh, and neither is she
exactly helpless.

894
00:57:38,937 --> 00:57:41,462
So, where's it writ
that we got to lay down
our lives for her?

895
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,098
Which is what you've
steered us toward.

896
00:57:43,175 --> 00:57:44,904
I didn't start this.

897
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:47,068
No, that's right.

898
00:57:47,913 --> 00:57:51,576
Alliance starts the war,
and then you volunteer.

899
00:57:53,518 --> 00:57:55,213
Battle of Serenity, Mal.

900
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:58,518
Besides Zoe here, how many....
Hey, I'm talking at you.

901
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:05,587
How many men in your platoon
came out of there alive?

902
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:10,961
You wanna leave this room.

903
00:58:13,805 --> 00:58:15,534
Damn right, I do.

904
00:58:22,881 --> 00:58:24,906
This isn't
the war, Mal.

905
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:28,014
You telling me that
'cause you think I don't know?

906
00:58:28,086 --> 00:58:30,213
You came to the Training House
looking for a fight.

907
00:58:30,288 --> 00:58:32,188
I came looking for you.

908
00:58:33,492 --> 00:58:35,960
I just want to know
who I'm dealing with.

909
00:58:36,061 --> 00:58:38,689
I've seen too many versions
of you to be sure.

910
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:43,196
I start fighting a war,
I guarantee
you'll see something new.

911
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:51,603
We'll get off.

912
00:58:51,676 --> 00:58:53,303
River and I will
get off at Haven.

913
00:58:53,378 --> 00:58:55,141
We'll find some--
Nobody's saying that.

914
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:57,044
Nobody besides Jayne
is saying that.

915
00:58:57,115 --> 00:58:58,104
Mal.

916
00:59:00,585 --> 00:59:03,679
I got no answers
for you, lnara.
I got no rudder.

917
00:59:03,755 --> 00:59:06,724
Wind blows northerly,
I go north.
That's who I am.

918
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:09,352
Now, maybe that ain't
a man to lead,
but they have to follow.

919
00:59:09,427 --> 00:59:10,519
So you wanna tear me down...

920
00:59:10,595 --> 00:59:12,756
do it inside your own mind.
I'm not trying
to tear you down.

921
00:59:12,831 --> 00:59:14,423
But you fog things up.

922
00:59:15,233 --> 00:59:16,928
You always have.

923
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,003
You spin me about.

924
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:25,369
I wish like hell
you was elsewhere.

925
00:59:27,579 --> 00:59:28,671
I was.

[doorknob rattling]

935
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:28,762
She's out. Jayne's down.

936
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:31,492
The other way.
Find her and do not engage.

937
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,617
[beeping]

938
01:01:53,859 --> 01:01:55,349
It's gonna be okay--

939
01:01:57,496 --> 01:01:58,485
[coughs]

940
01:02:05,938 --> 01:02:08,099
She's sealed off the bridge.
I do not like her there.

941
01:02:08,173 --> 01:02:09,868
Check the shuttle.
She could have snuck in.

942
01:02:09,942 --> 01:02:10,931
Captain.

943
01:02:44,142 --> 01:02:45,769
[computer beeps]

944
01:02:56,989 --> 01:02:59,890
The government's man,
he says you're a danger to us.

945
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:02,519
Not worth helping.

946
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:06,290
Is he right?

947
01:03:07,632 --> 01:03:10,032
Are you anything but a weapon?

948
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:16,299
I've staked my crew's life on
the theory you're a person...

949
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:19,572
actual and whole,
and if I'm wrong,
you'd best shoot me now.

950
01:03:19,644 --> 01:03:20,633
[clicks]

951
01:03:20,812 --> 01:03:22,677
Or we could talk more.

952
01:03:33,725 --> 01:03:34,817
Miranda.

953
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,330
How can it be there's
a whole planet
called Miranda...

954
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,662
and none of us knowed that?

955
01:03:42,734 --> 01:03:46,101
Because there isn't one.
It's a blackrock.
Uninhabitable.

956
01:03:46,605 --> 01:03:49,665
Terraforming didn't hold,
or some such.
Few settlers died.

957
01:03:49,741 --> 01:03:51,265
(Zoe)
Was it right before the war?

958
01:03:51,343 --> 01:03:55,211
I had to show them.
I didn't know if you were
going to make me sleep.

959
01:03:56,915 --> 01:03:59,008
You could have asked.
(Kaylee)
Wait a tick, yeah.

960
01:03:59,084 --> 01:04:02,747
Some years back,
there was call for workers
to settle on Miranda.

961
01:04:02,821 --> 01:04:04,584
Daddy talked about it.
Nothing about it...

962
01:04:04,656 --> 01:04:06,681
on the Cortex.
History, Astronomy,
it's not in there.

963
01:04:06,758 --> 01:04:09,090
Half of writing history
is hiding the truth.

964
01:04:09,161 --> 01:04:12,096
There's something
on that rock the Alliance
doesn't want known.

965
01:04:12,164 --> 01:04:14,359
That's right at the edge
of the Burnham Quadrant,
right?

966
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,765
Furthest planet out?
It's not that far from here.

967
01:04:16,835 --> 01:04:18,564
Whoa. No. No. Honey...
That's a bad notion.

968
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:21,003
...you show them the bad.
I got it, baby.

969
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:27,305
(Zoe)
This is us, at Haven,
and here's Miranda.

970
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:32,077
All along here,
that empty space in between,
that's Reaver territory.

971
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:34,846
They just float out there,
sending out raiding parties.

972
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,218
Nobody ventures there.
Not even the Alliance.

973
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:39,553
You go through that,
you're signing up
to be a banquet.

974
01:04:39,624 --> 01:04:42,252
I'm on board with our standard
run-and-hide scenario.

975
01:04:42,327 --> 01:04:44,056
And we are just about....

976
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:45,819
Wait.

977
01:05:03,215 --> 01:05:05,342
(Jayne)
Doesn't look like Reavers.
Wasn't.

978
01:05:11,189 --> 01:05:12,178
(Kaylee)
Shepherd?

979
01:05:13,992 --> 01:05:15,118
Shepherd?

980
01:05:16,461 --> 01:05:17,723
(Kaylee)
Shepherd Book?

981
01:05:35,847 --> 01:05:36,836
[cocking gun]

982
01:05:36,915 --> 01:05:37,904
[man coughing]

983
01:05:38,783 --> 01:05:40,216
Get the Doc.

984
01:05:41,653 --> 01:05:42,642
Shepherd.

985
01:05:42,721 --> 01:05:43,710
[gasping]

986
01:05:43,822 --> 01:05:46,689
Don't move.
Won't go far.

987
01:05:49,194 --> 01:05:51,185
Shouldn't have been you.

988
01:05:51,997 --> 01:05:54,625
Alliance should've hit us.
Should've hit me.

989
01:05:56,001 --> 01:05:57,730
That crossed my mind.

990
01:06:02,274 --> 01:06:05,402
I shot him down.
Yeah. I see.

991
01:06:05,644 --> 01:06:08,204
I killed the ship
that killed us.

992
01:06:09,948 --> 01:06:11,916
Not very Christian of me.

993
01:06:12,384 --> 01:06:13,908
You did what's right.

994
01:06:14,386 --> 01:06:18,447
Coming from you,
that means almost nothing.

995
01:06:24,029 --> 01:06:26,589
I'm long gone.
No, Doc will bring
you around.

996
01:06:26,665 --> 01:06:29,566
I look to be bored
by many more sermons
before you slip.

997
01:06:29,634 --> 01:06:30,896
Just don't move.

998
01:06:31,536 --> 01:06:33,333
Can't order me
around, boy.

999
01:06:34,606 --> 01:06:36,369
I'm not one
of your crew.

1000
01:06:38,476 --> 01:06:39,875
Yes, you are.

1001
01:06:42,714 --> 01:06:44,579
River....
Come on.

1002
01:06:45,016 --> 01:06:46,005
Hey.

1003
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:51,745
I don't care
what you believe.
Just believe it.

1004
01:06:53,425 --> 01:06:55,222
Whatever you....

1005
01:07:28,693 --> 01:07:30,718
How come
they ain't waiting?

1006
01:07:31,896 --> 01:07:34,865
They knowed we was coming,
how come they only sent one?

1007
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:38,333
They didn't know
we were coming here.

1008
01:07:39,137 --> 01:07:40,832
Get on the Cortex.

1009
01:07:40,939 --> 01:07:42,804
Wave, Li Shen,
the Sanchez brothers...

1010
01:07:42,874 --> 01:07:46,366
anyone who has ever
sheltered us after a heist.
Tell them to get out.

1011
01:07:46,444 --> 01:07:47,672
Get out now.

1012
01:07:58,857 --> 01:08:00,017
I'm sorry.

1013
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,926
If your quarry goes to ground,
leave no ground to go to.

1014
01:08:07,065 --> 01:08:09,090
You should have
taken my offer.

1015
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:11,727
Or did you think none of this
was your fault?

1016
01:08:12,003 --> 01:08:13,971
I don't murder children.

1017
01:08:14,372 --> 01:08:15,361
I do.

1018
01:08:16,308 --> 01:08:18,333
If I have to.
Why?

1019
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:22,372
Do you even know
why they sent you?

1020
01:08:23,148 --> 01:08:24,911
It's not my place to ask.

1021
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:28,676
I believe in something
greater than myself.

1022
01:08:29,788 --> 01:08:31,187
A better world.

1023
01:08:31,823 --> 01:08:33,654
A world without sin.

1024
01:08:34,192 --> 01:08:36,183
So me and mine
gotta lay down and die...

1025
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:38,456
so you can live
in your better world?

1026
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:41,057
I'm not going to live there.

1027
01:08:41,466 --> 01:08:43,058
There's no place
for me there...

1028
01:08:43,134 --> 01:08:45,602
any more than
there is for you. Malcolm...

1029
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:47,032
I'm a monster.

1030
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,004
What I do is evil.

1031
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:52,635
I have no illusions about it,
but it must be done.

1032
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,178
Keep talking.

1033
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,538
You're not getting
a location trace
off this wave.

1034
01:08:56,614 --> 01:09:00,516
And every minute
you keep River Tam from me,
more people will die.

1035
01:09:00,585 --> 01:09:03,076
You think I care?
Of course you care.

1036
01:09:04,055 --> 01:09:05,784
You're not a Reaver, Mal.

1037
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:09,749
You're a human man
and you will never
understand how--

1038
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:17,831
Get these bodies together.

1039
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:19,667
(Zoe)
We got time
for grave digging?

1040
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,228
Zoe, you and Simon
rope them together.

1041
01:09:21,306 --> 01:09:23,672
Five or six.
I want them laid out
on the nose of our ship.

1042
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:24,868
Are you insane?

1043
01:09:24,943 --> 01:09:26,240
I won't desecrate
these bodies.

1044
01:09:26,311 --> 01:09:28,176
I don't understand.
What do you mean,
the bodies--

1045
01:09:28,246 --> 01:09:29,679
I want you to muck up
the reactor core.

1046
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:31,773
Just enough to leave a trail
and make it read like...

1047
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:34,011
we're flying
without containment,
not enough to fry us.

1048
01:09:34,085 --> 01:09:35,882
These people
are our friends.
Kaylee...

1049
01:09:35,954 --> 01:09:38,787
you got a day's work to do
and two hours to do it.

1050
01:09:39,824 --> 01:09:44,090
Jayne, you and Wash
hoist up the cannon mount.
Goes right on top.

1051
01:09:44,162 --> 01:09:45,823
Piece or two
of the other ship,
stick it on.

1052
01:09:45,897 --> 01:09:49,128
Any place you can tear hull
without inner breach,
do that, too.

1053
01:09:49,968 --> 01:09:53,233
We're gonna need paint.
We're gonna need red paint.

1054
01:09:53,738 --> 01:09:54,727
Sir...

1055
01:09:55,206 --> 01:09:58,664
do you really mean
to turn our home
into an abomination...

1056
01:09:58,743 --> 01:10:00,540
so that we can make
a suicidal attempt...

1057
01:10:00,612 --> 01:10:02,637
at passing through
Reaver space?

1058
01:10:02,747 --> 01:10:04,044
I mean to live.

1059
01:10:04,482 --> 01:10:05,915
[man coughing]
I mean for us to live.

1060
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:08,578
The Alliance won't have that,
so we go where
they don't follow.

1061
01:10:08,653 --> 01:10:10,814
God's balls,
there ain't no way
we're going out there.

1062
01:10:10,889 --> 01:10:12,584
Mal, think about
what you're asking.

1063
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:14,852
(Jayne)
...those Reavers'll
eat us alive--

1064
01:10:16,594 --> 01:10:17,993
This is how it is.

1065
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:20,125
Anybody doesn't wanna
fly with me anymore...

1066
01:10:20,198 --> 01:10:22,029
this is your port of harbor.

1067
01:10:22,901 --> 01:10:24,926
There's a lot
of fine ways to die.

1068
01:10:25,003 --> 01:10:27,733
I ain't waiting
for the Alliance
to choose mine.

1069
01:10:28,673 --> 01:10:29,833
[gun firing]

1070
01:10:31,309 --> 01:10:32,776
I mean to confound
these bungers.

1071
01:10:32,844 --> 01:10:34,505
Take my shot
at getting to Miranda.

1072
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:37,173
Maybe find something I can use
to get clear of this.

1073
01:10:37,248 --> 01:10:40,149
So I hear a word
out of any of you
that ain't helping me out...

1074
01:10:40,218 --> 01:10:42,709
or taking your leave,
I will shoot you down.

1075
01:10:47,659 --> 01:10:48,956
Get to work.

1076
01:11:14,486 --> 01:11:15,544
(Zoe)
Sir--

1077
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,451
Just tell me
when we're close.

1078
01:11:53,091 --> 01:11:54,752
[people screaming]

1079
01:12:24,656 --> 01:12:25,645
(Mal)
Wash.

1080
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:33,519
Define "disappeared."

1081
01:13:38,262 --> 01:13:40,526
(Zoe)
Every reading
I'm getting says normal.

1082
01:13:41,265 --> 01:13:44,598
Oceans, land masses.
No tectonic instability
or radiation.

1083
01:13:44,669 --> 01:13:47,638
Yeah, but no power,
either.
Nothing at all?

1084
01:13:47,705 --> 01:13:48,694
Wait.

1085
01:13:49,374 --> 01:13:50,466
Something.

1086
01:13:51,542 --> 01:13:54,010
It might be a beacon,
but it's awful weak.

1087

it isn't what we thought.

and it stayed buried
till River dug it up.

This is what
they feared she knew.

And they were
right to fear...

than I have before.

maybe on this very ground
swept clean.

01:43:38,628 --> 01:43:40,755
You've done remarkable things.

1406
01:43:41,998 --> 01:43:44,193
But you're fighting a war...

1407
01:43:45,401 --> 01:43:46,595
you've already lost.

1408

[gasping]

1410
01:43:51,441 --> 01:43:53,341
Well, I'm known for that.

1411
01:43:55,244 --> 01:43:56,233
[groaning]

1412
01:44:02,251 --> 01:44:05,880
Piece of shrapnel tore up
that nerve cluster
my first tour.

1413
01:44:06,456 --> 01:44:07,787
Had it moved.

1414
01:44:09,392 --> 01:44:10,825
Sorry about the throat.

1415
01:44:11,427 --> 01:44:14,260
Expect you'd want to say your
famous last words right now.

1416
01:44:15,331 --> 01:44:16,889
Just one trouble.

1417
01:44:21,637 --> 01:44:23,127
I ain't gonna kill you.

1418
01:44:23,773 --> 01:44:25,070
[gasping]

1419
01:44:26,609 --> 01:44:29,703
Hell, I'm gonna grant
your greatest wish.

01:44:31,414 --> 01:44:32,403
[beeping]

1421
01:44:37,053 --> 01:44:39,886
I'm gonna show you
a world without sin.

1422
01:44:45,728 --> 01:44:47,787
These are just a few of
the few images we've recorded.

1423
01:44:47,864 --> 01:44:48,853
And you can see...

1424
01:44:51,767 --> 01:44:53,928
it isn't what we thought.

1425
01:44:55,638 --> 01:44:57,503
There's been no war here...

1426
01:44:58,207 --> 01:45:02,473
and no terraforming event.
The environment is stable.

1427
01:45:04,146 --> 01:45:05,909
It's the Pax.

1428
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:11,917
The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate
that we added
to the air processors.

1429
01:45:12,622 --> 01:45:15,216
It was supposed to calm
the population--

[roaring]

1431
01:45:43,819 --> 01:45:45,480
We meant it for the best...

1432
01:45:46,389 --> 01:45:47,947
to make people safer.

1433

[Reavers growling]

Sir?
It's done.

1439
01:46:19,522 --> 01:46:20,853
Report.

1440
01:46:23,025 --> 01:46:24,185
River?

1441
01:46:49,752 --> 01:46:50,741
(soldier #1)
Drop your weapons!

1442
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:51,844
(soldier #2)
Do it now.

1443
01:46:51,921 --> 01:46:53,388
Weapons down.
Let it down, now.

1444
01:46:53,456 --> 01:46:55,048
I want to see
your hands in the air.

1445
01:46:55,124 --> 01:46:56,989
Stand down.
Do it.

1446
01:47:02,465 --> 01:47:03,932
Targets are acquired.

1447
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,399
Do we have a kill order?

1448
01:47:08,371 --> 01:47:10,134
Do we have an order?

1449
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:19,542
(Operative)
Stand down.

1450
01:47:20,683 --> 01:47:23,447
Stand down. It's finished.

1451
01:47:27,223 --> 01:47:28,588
We're finished.

1452
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:32,845
It's not over,
you know.

1453
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:37,246
I can't guarantee
that they won't
come after you.

1454
01:49:38,087 --> 01:49:39,076
The Parliament.

1455
01:49:39,955 --> 01:49:42,947
Your broadwave about Miranda
has weakened their regime.

1456
01:49:43,025 --> 01:49:47,394
They are not gone
and they are not...forgiving.

1457
01:49:47,963 --> 01:49:50,431
That don't bode
especially well for you...

1458
01:49:51,167 --> 01:49:54,193
giving the order to let us go,
patching up our hurt.

1459
01:49:55,571 --> 01:49:59,007
I told them the Tams
were no longer a threat,
damage done.

1460
01:49:59,542 --> 01:50:01,066
They might listen...

1461
01:50:01,811 --> 01:50:05,212
but I think they know
I'm no longer their man.

1462
01:50:06,982 --> 01:50:10,076
They take you down,
I don't expect
to grieve over much.

1463
01:50:12,321 --> 01:50:14,755
Like to kill you myself,
I see you again.

1464
01:50:15,591 --> 01:50:16,580
You won't.

1465
01:50:19,528 --> 01:50:21,723
There is nothing left to see.

1466
01:50:27,436 --> 01:50:28,960
Sir, we have
a green light.

1467
01:50:29,371 --> 01:50:31,601
Inspection's pos
and we're clear
for up-thrust.

1468
01:50:38,113 --> 01:50:40,206
Think she'll hold together?

1469
01:50:41,217 --> 01:50:43,845
She's tore up plenty.
But she'll fly true.

1470
01:50:48,157 --> 01:50:50,387
Make sure
everything's secure.

1471
01:50:52,261 --> 01:50:55,162
Could be bumpy.
Always is.

1472
01:51:02,571 --> 01:51:03,595
Taking her out...

1473
01:51:03,672 --> 01:51:06,232
should be about a day's ride
to get you back to your girls.

1474
01:51:06,308 --> 01:51:07,468
Right.

1475
01:51:08,878 --> 01:51:11,108
Ready to get off this heap,
back to civilized life?

1476
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:12,169
I, uh....

1477
01:51:16,952 --> 01:51:18,317
I don't know.

1478
01:51:20,322 --> 01:51:21,482
Good answer.

1479
01:51:46,715 --> 01:51:49,240
So, you gonna ride
shotgun with me,
help me fly?

1480
01:51:49,485 --> 01:51:50,713
That's the plan.

1481
01:51:51,387 --> 01:51:52,945
Think you can work out--

1482

[engine revving]

1483
01:52:00,596 --> 01:52:01,585
Okay.

It ain't all buttons
and charts, little albatross.

You know what the first rule
of flying is?

1487
01:52:13,208 --> 01:52:16,200
Well, I suppose you do,
since you already know
what I'm about to say.

1488
01:52:17,246 --> 01:52:18,713
(River)
I do.

1489
01:52:19,882 --> 01:52:21,611
But I like to hear you say it.

01:52:26,422 --> 01:52:27,411
Love.

1491

You can learn all the math
in the 'verse...

1492
01:52:29,725 --> 01:52:31,750
but you take a boat in
the air that you don't love...

1493

she'll shake you off
just as sure as
the turn of the worlds.

Love keeps her in the air
when she ought to fall down...

tells you she's hurting
before she keels.

1496
01:52:47,343 --> 01:52:48,571
Makes her a home.

[rain pattering]

Storm's getting worse.

We'll pass through it
soon enough.

(Mal)
What was that?
