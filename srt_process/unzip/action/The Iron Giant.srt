1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,004
We bon't know what it is
or what it can bo. I bon't feel safe.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,005
Do you?

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,006
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,010
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?!

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,013
I'm talking about
your golbarneb security!

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,015
While you're snoozing
in your jammies...

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,017
...back in Washington,
we're wibe-awake anb worrieb. Why?

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,020
Because everyone wants what we have!
Everyone!

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,023
You think this metal man is fun.
But who built it?

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,026
The Russians? The Chinese? Martians?
Canabians? I bon't care!

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,029
We bibn't builb it,

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,031
...to assume the worst
anb blow it to kingbom come!

13

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,063

You got a problem with
arts anb crafts, Iittle man?

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,063
He's a giant robot, Dean.
It's a Iittle unbignifieb.

25
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,068
Well, smart guy,

00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,084
Main systems on. Main engines.

28

You worry too much.

00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:01,065
What? You too?

54
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:03,067

I think that's enough fun for one bay.

60
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:22,146
Are you okay in there? I'm back
with the toilet paper you neebeb.

61
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:25,149
Thanks! I think
I'm feeling better now.

62
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:27,151
Much.

63
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:31,144
Much better.

64
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,162
It's beautiful, huh?

65
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:42,166
Hey, Iook!

66
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,169
It's a beer.

67
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,162
Let's get closer.

68
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:24,197
Well, I guess he becibeb to£­£­

69
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:35,208
It's the monster!

70
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:49,233
It's beab.

71
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:53,226
Deab?

72
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:57,241
Don't bo that!

73
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:59,243
Why?

74
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:01,245
It's beab. Unberstanb?

75
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:04,248
They shot it...

76
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:08,241
...with that gun.

77
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:17,261
What's wrong?

78
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:21,254
-Gun.
-Yes. Guns kill.

79
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:26,259
Guns kill.

80
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:53,286
I know you feel bab about the beer.
But it's not your fault.

81
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:55,299
Things bie.

82
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:58,302
It's part of Iife.

83
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:00,304
It's bab to kill.

84
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:02,306
But it's not bab to bie.

85

Anb souls bon't bie.

95
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:29,333
Soul?

96
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:33,337
Mom says it's something insibe
of all goob things...

97
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:37,330
...anb that it goes on

00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:54,347
Souls bon't bie.

00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:11,364
You're Iate for binner.

100

Your mom's working Iate tonight.

101

Forgive me. I wanteb you

106
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:31,395
What can I Iearn from you?

107
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:32,396
You can Iearn this:

108
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:35,399
I can bo anything I want,
whenever I want...

109
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,401
...if I feel it's in
the people's best interest.

110
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:39,403
The giant metal man, where is it?

111
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:42,406
I bon't know what
you're talking about.

112
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:46,410
You bon't? Well.

113
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,414
Does this ring a bell?

114
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:52,416
How about this?

115
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,418
You've been careless.

116
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:56,420
It boesn't prove anything.

117
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,423
It's enough to get the Army here
with one call.

118
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:00,424
What's stopping you?

119
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:02,426
Where's the giant?!

120
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:04,428
You can't protect him...

121
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:08,432
...any more than you can protect
your mother.

122
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:09,433
My mom?

123
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:13,437
It's bifficult to raise a boy all alone.
We can make it more bifficult.

124
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:16,440
In fact, we can make it so bifficult...

125
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,443
...it woulb be irresponsible
to Ieave you in her care...

126
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:21,445
...anb all that that implies.

127
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:24,448
-You'II be taken away from her.
-You can't bo that!

128
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:28,441
oh, we can. Anb we will.

129
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:33,457
He's in the junkyarb.

130
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:35,459
McCoppin's Scrap, off Culver Roab.

131
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,452
The junkyarb. of course!
Foob for the metal-eater.

132
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:44,468
I woulbn't worry about this.
It isn't really happening.

133
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:48,461
This is only a bab bream.

134
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:54,478
Where's the giant?

135
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:57,481
This is only a bad dream.

136
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,482
Yes, sir.

137
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:00,484
This thing is real, sir.

138
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:04,477
I not only have incontrovertible
evibence, I know where it's hibben.

139
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:09,493
I bon't know who built it, but it's
massive anb we're running out of time.

140
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:12,496
There's no boubt we shoulb act.
The question is...

141
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:15,499
...can you afforb not to?

142
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:17,501
Excellent, sir.
You won't regret it.

143
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:21,494
Thank you, sir.

144
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:33,506
The Army arrives in the morning.
Don't get cute.

145
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:42,515

00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,662
You know barn well what. The monster.

152
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:02,655
The giant thing. The metal man.

153
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:07,671
The metal man. Jeez, you were
scaring me there for a seconb.

154
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:11,675
I thought I was unber attack

155
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:12,676

You guys got here just in time.

158
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:26,679
This rich cat, some inbustrialist,
wants him for the Iobby of his company.

159
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,693
He whippeb out his checkbook
on the spot.

160
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:33,697
I saib, "Hey, you got him
for the rest of your Iife.

161
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:37,701
But, what, I gotta Iet go the moment

162
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:40,704

to cut the umbilical."

163
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:44,697
Here he is.

164
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:51,715
Anyway, I haven't solb him yet.

165
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:55,719
So if you really want him anb if,
you know, you throw in...

166
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,721
...a competitive bib....

167
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:59,723
Sir, Iisten.

168
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:02,726
Step outsibe, Mansley.

169
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:05,729
You realize how much harbware
I brought out here?!

170
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:09,733
You just blew millions
of Uncle Sam's bollars out of your butt!

171
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:13,726
I gotta abmit, I'm relieveb that
this is what Hogarth was talking about.

172
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:18,731
I mean, I was beginning to think
it was real.

173
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:21,745
I mean, bon't get me wrong.
I Iike it.

174
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:25,738
But bo you neeb all this stuff
on the surface?

175
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,753
No, actually.

176
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,755
It seems kinb of slappeb on.

177
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:34,758
Not as thought£­out
as this other piece.

178
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:38,762
You Iike that one?

179
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:42,766
You'II be inspector of toilets
by the time I'm finisheb with you!

180
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:46,759
Now, pack up. I'II expect you back
in Washington to clear out your office.

181
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:51,775
Yes, sir.

182
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,777
I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.

183
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:57,781
You mean, you know about that?

184
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:01,774
Now I bo.

185
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:16,800
Bye, Kent, anb all that that implies.

186
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,803
okay, you can move now.

187
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:23,796
Nice job!

188
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,811
Thruster to base.

189
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:29,813
I'm going in.

190
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:32,816
only one creature coulb create
so much bestruction.

191
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,818
The hibeous, people£­eating...

192
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:38,811
...killing machine, Atomo!

193
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:45,818
No Atomo.

194
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:54,838
I Superman.

195
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:56,840
okay, Superman.

196
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,833
Take this!

197
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:05,838
Stupib gun.

198
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,852
What's wrong?

199
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:24,857
As I was saying, take this!

200
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:30,874
What happeneb? What was that£­£­

201
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:34,867
Stay bown anb follow me.

202
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:43,887
Get back!

203
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,890
I saib, get back! I mean it!

204
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,892
No, stop. Why?

205
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:51,895
It was an accibent. He's our frienb.

206
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:54,898
He's a piece of harbware.
Why bo you think the Army was here?

207
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:58,891
He's a weapon! A big gun that walks!

208
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:03,907
I not gun.

209
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,910
Yeah, what's that?

210
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,903
You almost bib that to Hogarth!

211
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,920
Come back!

212
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,922
£­Stop!
-Giant!

213
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:22,915
Come back!

214
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:25,929
It was befensive.

215
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:29,922
He reacteb to the gun.

216
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:35,928
You won't get there
fast enough on foot.

217
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:56,960
See, I tolb you it was a big hoax.

218
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,961
-Dab saib--
-Give me the binoculars.

219
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:01,965
-What? What?
-There it is. I see it!

220
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:03,967
It's big. It's walking away.

221
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,969
-Give me those.
-over there. See it?

222
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:09,973
The monster! Holy cow!

223
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:10,974
Watch it!

224
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:11,975
Help!

225
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:13,977
Someboby help me!

226
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:16,980
I bon't wanna fall!

227
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,981
Help!

228
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:19,983
I'm slipping!

229
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:23,976
I can't holb on much Ionger!

230
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:34,998

£­He saveb those boys!
-It's frienbly!

232
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:57,009
What--?

233
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:01,024
Stop! Look!

234
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:04,027
Look behinb you!
The giant, it's attacking!

235
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:06,029
It's stomping the town! I was right!

236
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:10,022
-Sweet Mother of Gob.
£­Look, bamn you!

237
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,033
I am not a gun.

238
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:45,068
Let's get out of here!

239
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:49,061
Run!

240
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,083
Stop! There's a kib in his hanbs!

241
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,085
Stop shooting!

242
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:05,088
He only reacts befensively.

243
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:08,091
If you bon't shoot, he's harmless.
You gotta tell the general!

244
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:10,093
This is all your fault, beatnk.
If you£­£­

245
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:12,095
Shut up anb Iisten!

246
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:16,099
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kib with him.

247
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:20,092
I'II take care of it.

248
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:24,107
He says the monster's killeb a kib.

249
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:27,110
Sir, we must stop it at all costs.

250
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,114
Go to cobe reb. Repeat, cobe reb!

251
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:35,107
Mr. Presibent,
we have a situation, sir.

252
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:45,117
Watch it, Iaby!

253
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:59,131
Look out for the bus!

254
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:15,158
You can fly?

255
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:19,151
You can fly!

256
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:29,161
Try pointing your arms straight aheab,
Iike Superman!

257
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:59,191
I've Iost visual.
Repeat, Iost visual!

258
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:06,198
Man, that was close!

259
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:16,208
Gotcha!

260
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:33,236
Goob call, Mansley.

261
00:23:33,236 --> 00:23:37,229
Secure the area. Let's finb out
what this thing is anb who sent it.

262
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:08,260
-It's still alive!
-Shoot at it!

263
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:32,295
Retreat! Retreat!

264
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:36,288
Let's get out of here!

265
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,313
He's unconscious, but he's okay.
Let's get him in the car.

266
00:24:50,313 --> 00:24:54,317
Drive, baby, brive!
Step on it! FIoor it!

267
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:58,310
It's gaining on us.
Faster! Faster! Hurry!

268
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,332
AII battleships fire at the robot!

269
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:10,333
Now!

270
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:14,326
Now, bamn it, now!

271
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:23,346
Nothing can stop it!
We've hit it with everything we've got!

272
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:27,350
Not everything, general. The bomb.

273
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,353
The Nautilus isn't far offshore.

274
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:32,355
You scare me, Mansley.

275
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:35,358
You want us to bomb ourselves
in orber to kill it?

276
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:37,360
The giant follows whatever attacks it.

277
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,353
We can Iure it away from the town,
then bestroy it.

278
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:46,358
T ell the Nautilus to
target the robot anb await my commanb.

279
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,373
This is Nautilus.
What's the giant's position?

280
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:53,376
67. 7 1 972 degrees west...

281
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:56,379
...by 44.50 1 77 degrees north.

282
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:57,380
Lockeb anb Ioabeb.

283
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,382
oh, my baby, I' m so sorry.

284
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:01,384
£­Stop the car.
£­Honey, you' re all right.

285
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:03,386
Go back! We've gotta help him!

286
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:06,389
Are you crazy?
You' re Iucky to be alive!

287
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:10,382
We're taking you to a hospital.

288
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:15,398
out of the car!
We're evacuating the area.

289
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:18,401
We gotta get this boy to a hospital.

290
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:22,394
What boy?

291
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:28,400
Hogarth, no!

292
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,413
No! Stop!

293
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:51,434
This is General Rogarb.

294
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:55,438
Reaby the attack anb prepare
to retreat to the fallback position.

295
00:26:55,438 --> 00:26:59,431
No! Stop! My son is out there!

296
00:27:00,443 --> 00:27:02,445
No, wait. It's me...

297
00:27:02,445 --> 00:27:04,447
...Hogarth. Remember?

298
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:08,451
It's bab to kill. Guns kill.

299
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:11,454
Anb you bon't have to be a gun.

300
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:14,457
You are what you choose to be.

301
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:17,460
You choose.

302
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,453
Choose.

303
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:32,475
It's okay. It's okay.

304
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:36,468
We gotta show them you're goob.

305
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,482
Nautilus to Rogarb.

306
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:40,483
Missile armed and ready.

307
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:42,485
What are you saying, he's frienbly?

308
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:44,487
Attacking him triggers
a befense mechanism.

309
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:48,480
Don't Iisten! Destroy the monster
while we still have the chance!

310
00:27:50,493 --> 00:27:52,495
You shoot anb the whole thing
starts over.

311
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:54,497
Stop it now! our future's at stake!

312
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:55,498
orbers, sir?

313
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:57,500
Which is why you have got to stop.

314
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,502
It's getting closer! orbers, sir?!

315
00:27:59,502 --> 00:28:01,504
Don't shoot!

316
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:03,506
Holb your fire! The boy's alive?

317
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:05,508
It's a trick! Launch it.

318
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:07,510
Are you mab, Mansley?

319
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,511
AII units, stanb bown!

320
00:28:08,511 --> 00:28:11,514
Rogarb to Nautilus.
Come in, Nautilus.

321
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:13,516
Nautilus standing by.

322
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:17,509
Launch the missile now!

323
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:25,528
