1
00:00:02,872 --> 00:00:07,171
'T was the morphine he took for
the wounds he suffered in his heart.

2
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:14,676
He would rage and he would cry,
my lost soldier.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,278
And I said to him,
"There are two of you.

4
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:25,018
Don't you see?

5
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:29,028
One that kills
and one that loves."

6
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:33,160
And he said to me...

7
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:38,000
"I don't know whether
I'm an animal or a god."

8
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,408
But you are both.

9
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:26,285
You want more?

10
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:35,423
All that matters
is that you're alive.

11
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:39,895
You are alive, Captain.

12
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:45,701
That's the truth.

13
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:01,645
There are two of you,
don't you see?

14
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:06,175
One that kills...

15
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:08,653
and one that loves.

16
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:40,085
Can't see nothing.
We stoppin'.

17
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:42,747
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

18
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:46,348
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.

19
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:48,360
I ain't riskin'
no more lives.

20
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:51,192
I'm in command here, goddamn it.
You'll do what I say.

21
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,867
You see anything, Chef?

22
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,968
Why don't they
fucking attack, man?

23
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:20,619
Watch it over here, Chief.

24
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,563
Got a stump.

25
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,128
On the fifties.

26
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,635
He was close.

27
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:34,233
He was real close.

28
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:38,800
l couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him...

29
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:40,880
as if the boat were being
sucked upriver...

30
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:43,814
and the water was
flowing back into the jungle.

31
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,253
Whatever was going to happen...

32
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:52,257
it wasn't going to be the way
they called it back in Nha Trang.

33
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:59,730
- Arrows!
- Fire!

34
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,936
Chef, open up! Fire!

35
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,406
Lance, fire!

36
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:22,111
Chef! Chef, it's okay.
Quit firing.

37
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:25,885
- They're just little toy arrows.
- Cut it out! Quiet!

38
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:28,962
Chief, tell them
to hold their fire!

39
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:31,623
They’re just little sticks.
They’re just trying to scare us.

40
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,723
Quiet!

41
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:36,735
You got us into this mess,
and now you can't get us out...

42
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,305
because you don't know where
the hell you're going, do ya?

43
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,533
Do ya?

44
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:44,805
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!

45
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:48,611
Lance, get the wheel!

46
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:52,948
You savages! Come and get it!
You son of a bitches!

47
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:14,798
A spear?

48
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:37,517
My mission is to make it
up into Cambodia.

49
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,559
There's a Green Beret colonel
up there who's gone insane...

50
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:42,060
and I'm supposed to kill him.

51
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:46,465
That's fucking typical!
Shit!

52
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:48,831
Fuckin' Vietnam mission!

53
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:52,633
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

54
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,436
That's fucking great!
That’s just fucking great, man.

55
00:07:56,544 --> 00:08:00,707
Shit!
That's fuckin' crazy.

56
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,783
I mean, I thought you were
going in to blow up a bridge...

57
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:07,183
or some fuckin'
railroad tracks or somethin'.

58
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,755
- That's all right.
- No. No, wait. Wait.

59
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:13,224
We'll go together, on the boat.
We'll go with you.

60
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:17,730
We'll go up there,
but on the boat. Okay?

61
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:26,288
Part of me was afraid
of what I would find...

62
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,800
and what l would do
when I got there.

63
00:09:30,772 --> 00:09:33,604
I knew the risks...

64
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,005
or imagined I knew.

65
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:40,505
But the thing
I felt the most...

66
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:43,708
much stronger than fear...

67
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:46,547
was the desire to confront him.

68
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,417
Just keep movin'.

69
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:04,657
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

70
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:34,045
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

71
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:38,448
I ain't comin' in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

72
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,052
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man.
Zap 'em with your siren.

73
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,537
There's mines over there
and mines over there too.

74
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:58,839
And watch out. Those goddamn
monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.

75
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:02,142
Ah, that's a pretty one.
Move it right in towards me.

76
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,012
I'm an American.

77
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,915
Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.

78
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:09,511
Hi. American.

79
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:11,716
American civilian.
It's all right.

80
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:15,693
And you got the cigarettes. And that's
what I've been dreaming about.

81
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:20,461
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

82
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:26,131
I'm a photojournalist.

83
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,935
I've covered the war
since '64.

84
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:31,602
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia and 'Nam.

85
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:39,078
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man.

86
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:41,450
Who are all these people?

87
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:45,355
Yeah, well, they think
you've come to--

88
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:46,789
to take him away.

89
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:50,056
- And I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

90
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:55,531
Him! Col. Kurtz.

91
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:59,401
These are all his children,
man, as far as you can see.

92
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:03,203
Hell, man, out here
we're all his children.

93
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:06,973
Could we talk to Col. Kurtz?

94
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:11,312
Hey, mac.
You don't talk to the colonel.

95
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:13,318
Well, you listen to him.

96
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:16,685
The man's enlarged my mind.

97
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:20,487
He's a poet warrior
in the classic sense.

98
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:22,494
I mean, sometimes he'll--

99
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:24,188
Well, you say hello to him,
right?

100
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,697
He'll just walk by you
and he won't even notice you.

101
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:30,429
Then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll
throw you in a corner and he'll say...

102
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,528
``Do you know that 'if'
is the middle word in 'life'?

103
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,540
If you can keep your head when all about
you are losing theirs and blaming you.

104
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,974
If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you.''

105
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,172
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

106
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:44,409
``I should have been
a pair of ragged claws...

107
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:47,384
scuttling across floors
of silent seas.''

108
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:49,717
- I mean--
- Stay with the boat.

109
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:54,260
Don't go any-- Don't go without me,
okay? I wanna get a picture.

110
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,396
He can be terrible
and he can be mean...

111
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,399
and he can be right.

112
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,527
He's fighting the war.
He's a great man.

113
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:09,841
I mean--

114
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,906
I wish I had words, you know.
I wish I had words.

115
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:19,042
I could tell you something like,
the other day he wanted to kill me.

116
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:21,882
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

117
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:24,388
Because I took his picture.

118
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:28,052
He said, ``If you take
my picture again...

119
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,686
I'm gonna kill you.''

120
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:32,697
And he meant it.

121
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:37,097
See, just lay cool.
Lay cool.

122
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,171
Lay back. Dig it.

123
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,139
He gets friendly again.
He really does.

124
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:45,575
But you don't-- you don't--
you don’t judge the colonel.

125
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,341
You don’t judge the colonel
like an ordinary man.

126
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:57,749
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans. Americans!

127
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:00,690
You can feel the vibe
of this place.

128
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:04,195
Let me take your picture. Hey,
could you hold-- Hey, hello. Hello.

129
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,197
Could you hold up
a minute?

130
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,653
Colby.

131
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:47,501
The heads.

132
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:49,802
You're looking at the heads.

133
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,106
I, uh-- Sometimes
he goes too far.

134
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:55,909
He's the first one
to admit it.

135
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:59,918
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!

136
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:04,121
If you could have heard
the man just two days ago--

137
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,852
if you could have heard
him then, God--

138
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:10,225
- You were gonna call him crazy?
- Fuckin' A!

139
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,664
I just wanna talk to him.

140
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:19,301
Well, man, he's gone away.

141
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:22,136
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

142
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:25,336
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.

143
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:28,346
He forgets himself
with his people.

144
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:32,480
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

145
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:35,577
Maybe we should wait
back at the boat.

146
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,178
- I think you should--
- Okay, Chef.

147
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,520
We'll go back to the boat
for a while.

148
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:42,356
Yeah, stay with Lance.

149
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,115
This colonel guy,
he's wacko, man.

150
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:10,781
He's worse than crazy.
He's evil!

151
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:13,324
I mean, that's what the man's got
set up here, man!

152
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,894
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

153
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:20,127
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?

154
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:23,327
Fuckin' A, I'll help you. I'll do
anything to get out of this joint.

155
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,633
- Good boy.
- We could blow all them assholes away.

156
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,573
They're so fuckin' spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

157
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:35,307
I ain't afraid of all them
fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.

158
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:40,852
I used to think if I died
in an evil place...

159
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:44,151
then my soul wouldn't be able
to make it to Heaven.

160
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:47,488
But now, fuck--

161
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:52,031
I mean, I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

162
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:55,932
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.

163
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:58,970
- Get out of here.
- I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

164
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:03,406
I'll go up with Lance and
scrounge around, check the place out.

165
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:05,944
See if I can find
the colonel, okay?

166
00:19:07,248 --> 00:19:10,273
Well, what do you
want me to do?

167
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:13,546
Here. You take the radio...

168
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:17,919
and if I don't get back
by 2200 hours...

169
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:22,086
you call in the air strike.

170
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:26,227
``Air strike?''

171
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,232
The code is ``Almighty''...

172
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,735
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

173
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,999
It's all in there.

174
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:39,569
Zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

175
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:50,789
Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane.

176
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,519
The place was full of bodies--

177
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,827
North Vietnamese,
Vietcong, Cambodians.

178
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:12,209
If I was still alive,
it was because he wanted me that way.

179
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:49,108
it smelled like
slow death in there--

180
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:51,547
malaria...

181
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:53,551
and nightmares.

182
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:58,356
This was the end
of the river, all right.

183
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:14,034
Where are you from, Willard?

184
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:21,346
I'm from Ohio, sir.

185
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,651
Were you born there?

186
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:30,950
Yes, sir.

187
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:33,252
Whereabouts?

188
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,259
Toledo, sir.

189
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:43,827
How far are you
from the river?

190
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,876
The Ohio River, sir?

191
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:56,113
About 200 miles.

192
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:07,187
I went down that river
once when I was a kid.

193
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:14,690
There's a place in the river--
I can't remember--

194
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:20,034
Must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

195
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,303
It's all wild and overgrown now.
But for about--

196
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,901
for about five miles
you'd think that...

197
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:30,471
heaven just fell
on the earth...

198
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:32,983
in the form of gardenias.

199
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:51,035
Have you ever considered...

200
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,739
any real freedoms?

201
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,610
Freedoms from
the opinion of others?

202
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:09,584
Even the opinions
of yourself?

203
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:28,870
Did they say why, Willard?

204
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:35,177
Why they wanted
to terminate my command?

205
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:54,122
I was sent on
a classified mission, sir.

206
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,096
It's no longer
classified, is it?

207
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:09,877
What did they tell you?

208
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:14,651
They told me...

209
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:17,416
that you had gone...

210
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,423
totally insane...

211
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:25,554
and that your methods...

212
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,566
were unsound.

213
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:34,498
Are my methods unsound?

214
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:43,541
I don't see any method...

215
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:46,951
at all, sir.

216
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,653
I expected...

217
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:57,922
someone like you.

218
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:02,057
What did you expect?

219
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,575
Are you an assassin?

220
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:18,078
I'm a soldier.

221
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:23,020
You're neither.

222
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:27,921
You're an errand boy...

223
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,689
sent by grocery clerks...

224
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:36,864
to collect the bill.

225
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,813
Why, huh?

226
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:25,975
Why would a nice guy
like you wanna kill a genius?

227
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,855
Feeling pretty good, huh?

228
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:36,360
Why?

229
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,989
Do you know--

230
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,761
Do you know that the man--

231
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,832
the man really likes you?

232
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:53,170
He likes you.
He really likes you.

233
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,182
But he's got something
in mind for you.

234
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,809
Aren't you curious about that?

235
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:05,880
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?

236
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:11,993
There's something
happening out here, man.

237
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:18,101
You know something, man.
I know something that you don't know.

238
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:21,071
That's right, Jack.

239
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:24,142
The man is clear
in his mind...

240
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:26,541
but his soul is mad.

241
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,304
Oh, yeah.

242
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,316
He's dying, I think.

243
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:35,478
He hates all this.
He hates it.

244
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:38,648
But the man's--

245
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:45,324
He reads poetry out loud,
all right?

246
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,030
And a voice--

247
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:51,694
a voice--

248
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:56,902
He likes you
'cause you're still alive.

249
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:02,037
He's got plans for you.
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.

250
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:06,084
You're gonna help him, man.
You're gonna help him.

251
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:08,915
I mean, what are they gonna say,
man, when he's gone, huh?

252
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:13,583
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

253
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:17,424
What are they gonna say about him? What
are they gonna say? He was a kind man?

254
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:21,022
He was a wise man?
He had plans? He had wisdom?

255
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:23,033
Bullshit, man!

256
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:28,368
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

257
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,538
You.

258
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:39,810
Almost eight hours.

259
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:47,418
I'm asleep.

260
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:51,053
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

261
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,007
Fuck.

262
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:09,980
Has it been eight hours?

263
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,409
Hello. Almighty. Almighty.

264
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:19,355
This is PBR Street Gang.
Radio check. Over.

265
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:23,258
PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.

266
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,243
Oh, Jesus!

267
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,318
Oh, Christ!

268
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:02,543
Time magazine.

269
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,942
The weekly newsmagazine.

September 22, 1 967.
Volume 90...

271
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:14,520
number 1 2.

272
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:18,756
``The War on the Horizon. The American
people may find it hard to believe...

273
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:21,594
that the US is winning
the war in Vietnam.

274
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:24,328
Nevertheless...

275
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,802
one of the most
exhaustive inquiries...

276
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:29,669
into the status
of the conflict yet compiled...

277
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:33,040
offers considerable evidence
that the weight of US power...

278
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:35,739
two-and-a-half years
after the big buildup began...

279
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,874
is beginning to
make itself felt.

280
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:42,681
White House officials maintain
the impact of that strength...

281
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:47,419
may bring the enemy
to the point where he could...

282
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,689
simply be unable
to continue fighting.''

283
00:33:52,632 --> 00:33:53,825
Is this familiar?

284
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:59,431
``Because Lyndon Johnson
fears that the US public...

285
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:02,871
is in no mood to accept
its optimistic conclusions...

286
00:34:02,976 --> 00:34:05,910
he may never permit the report
to be released in full.

287
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:09,208
Even so, he is sufficiently
impressed with the findings...

288
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:12,681
and sufficiently anxious to
make their conclusions known...

289
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:15,754
to permit experts
who have been working on it...

290
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:17,879
to talk about it
in general terms.''

291
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:21,989
No date, Time magazine.

292
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:38,667
``Sir Robert Thompson...

who led the victory
over Communist guerillas in Malaya...

is now a RAND corporation

recently returned to Vietnam to sound
out the situation for President Nixon.

296

that things felt
much better...

298
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:58,024
and smelled much better
over there.''

299
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:02,191
How do they smell
to you, soldier?

300
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:17,976
You'll be free.
You'll be under guard.

301

Read these at your leisure.

302

Don't lose them.

303
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:25,457
Don't try to escape.
You'll be shot.

304

We can talk
of these things later.

``We are the hollow men.

leaning together at peace
filled with straw.

308

Alas, our dried voices
when we whisper together...

309

are quiet and meaningless
as wind in dry grass...

broken glass in a dry cellar.

00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:27,655
Do you know what
the man's saying? Do you?

317
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:31,429
This is dialectics.
It's very simple dialectics.

318
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:35,097
It's one through nine.
No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.

319
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:38,574
You can't travel in space. You can't
go out into space, you know...

320
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:40,702
without like, you know,
with fractions.

321
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:43,303
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

322
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,815
What are you gonna do when
you go from here to Venus?

323
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:47,316
That's dialectic physics, okay.

324
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,819
Dialectic logic is,
there's only love and hate.

325
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:51,889
You either love somebody
or you hate 'em.

326
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:52,854
Mutt!

327
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:57,859
You mutt.

328
00:39:57,964 --> 00:40:00,693
This is the way
the fucking world is.

329
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,359
Look at this fucking shit
we're in, man!

330
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:05,402
Not with a bang.
A whimper.

331
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:08,996
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, Jack.

332
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:40,603
On the river, I thought that
the minute I looked at him...

333
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:42,366
I'd know what to do.

334
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:46,335
But it didn't happen.

335
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:50,609
I was in there with him
for days. Not under guard.

336
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:53,081
I was free.

337
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:56,416
But he knew
I wasn't going anywhere.

338
00:40:56,522 --> 00:41:00,116
He knew more about what
I was going to do than I did.

339
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:11,365
If the generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw...

340
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:13,802
would they still want me
to kill him?

341
00:41:15,374 --> 00:41:18,399
More than ever, probably.

342
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:21,445
And what would his people back home
want if they ever learned...

343
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:24,106
just how far from them
he'd really gone?

344
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:28,186
He broke from them...

345
00:41:28,287 --> 00:41:31,016
and then he broke
from himself.

346
00:41:31,123 --> 00:41:34,489
I'd never seen a man
so broken up and...

347
00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:36,493
ripped apart.

348
00:41:36,596 --> 00:41:39,291
I've seen the horrors--

349
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:41,729
horrors that you've seen.

350
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:45,293
But you have no right
to call me a murderer.

351
00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:48,497
You have a right to kill me.

352
00:41:48,608 --> 00:41:51,508
You have a right
to do that.

353
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:55,338
But you have no right
to judge me.

354
00:42:01,654 --> 00:42:03,951
It's impossible for words...

355
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:07,215
to describe...

356
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:12,493
what is necessary...

357
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:16,797
to those...

358
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:19,427
who do not know...

359
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:23,099
what horror means.

360
00:42:24,944 --> 00:42:26,342
Horror.

361
00:42:29,115 --> 00:42:32,015
Horror has a face.

362
00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:37,619
And you must make
a friend of horror.

363
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:41,351
Horror and moral terror...

364
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,359
are your friends.

365
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:45,588
If they are not...

366
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:49,497
then they are enemies
to be feared.

367
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:51,967
They are truly enemies.

368
00:42:56,676 --> 00:43:00,509
I remember when I was
with Special Forces.

369
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:07,975
Seems a thousand centuries ago.

370
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:14,186
We went into a camp
to inoculate...

371
00:43:16,462 --> 00:43:18,019
some children.

372
00:43:21,901 --> 00:43:24,630
We'd left the camp...

373
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:28,001
after we had inoculated
the children for polio.

374
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:32,370
And this old man came running
after us, and he was crying.

375
00:43:32,478 --> 00:43:34,377
He couldn't say.

376
00:43:36,816 --> 00:43:39,079
We went back there...

377
00:43:39,185 --> 00:43:42,915
and they had come
and hacked off...

378
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:45,546
every inoculated arm.

379
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:49,491
There they were,
in a pile--

380
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:51,152
a pile of...

381
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,697
little arms.

382
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:58,959
And I remember...

383
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:03,532
I-I-- I cried.

384
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:05,542
I wept like...

385
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:10,342
some grandmother.

386
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:16,851
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

387
00:44:16,956 --> 00:44:20,083
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

388
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:22,921
I never want to forget.

389
00:44:23,029 --> 00:44:25,792
And then I realized...

390
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:28,866
like I was shot--

391
00:44:28,968 --> 00:44:32,232
like I was shot
with a diamond--

392
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:36,000
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

393
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:41,444
And I thought,
``My God, the genius of that.

394
00:44:41,547 --> 00:44:43,946
The genius.''

395
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,813
The will to do that.

396
00:44:48,287 --> 00:44:53,053
Perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure.

397
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,859
And then I realized...

398
00:44:56,962 --> 00:45:00,795
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

399
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,629
These were not monsters.
These were men--

400
00:45:03,736 --> 00:45:06,226
trained cadres.

401
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:08,999
These men who fought
with their hearts...

402
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:11,098
who have families,
who have children...

403
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,143
who are filled with love...

404
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:16,611
that they had the strength--

405
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:18,615
the strength...

406
00:45:22,288 --> 00:45:24,187
to do that.

407
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:29,317
If I had ten divisions
of those men...

408
00:45:29,428 --> 00:45:32,919
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

409
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:37,660
You have to have men...

410
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,669
who are moral...

411
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,471
and at the same time...

412
00:45:43,576 --> 00:45:45,634
who are able to...

413
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:48,645
utilize their...

414
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,715
primordial instincts to kill...

415
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,788
without feeling,
without passion...

416
00:45:59,024 --> 00:46:02,652
without judgment--
without judgment.

417
00:46:07,032 --> 00:46:10,523
Because it’s judgment
that defeats us.

418
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:32,351
I worry that my son...

419
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:36,359
might not understand
what I've tried to be.

420
00:46:38,597 --> 00:46:43,727
And if I were
to be killed, Willard...

421
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,733
I would want someone
to go to my home...

422
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,172
and tell my son everything.

423
00:46:53,612 --> 00:46:58,105
Everything I did.
Everything you saw.

424
00:46:58,217 --> 00:47:02,243
Because there's nothing
that I detest more than...

425
00:47:02,354 --> 00:47:04,685
the stench of lies.

426
00:47:06,826 --> 00:47:10,056
And if you understand me,
Willard, you--

427
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:15,058
you will do this for me.

428
00:48:20,532 --> 00:48:24,331
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty. Over.

429
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:28,303
PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.

430
00:48:29,675 --> 00:48:34,373
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty
standing by. How do you copy?

431
00:48:39,084 --> 00:48:42,541
They were gonna make me
a major for this...

432
00:48:42,655 --> 00:48:45,646
and I wasn't even in
their fuckin' army anymore.

433
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:51,350
Everybody wanted me to do it.

434
00:48:51,463 --> 00:48:54,397
Him most of all.

435
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,933
I felt like he was up there...

436
00:48:57,036 --> 00:49:00,163
waiting for me
to take the pain away.

437
00:49:02,241 --> 00:49:04,868
He just wanted to go out
like a soldier...

438
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:07,672
standing up.

439
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,806
Not like some poor,
wasted, rag-assed renegade.

440
00:49:15,154 --> 00:49:18,247
Even the jungle wanted him dead.

441
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:21,621
And that’s who he really
took his orders from anyway.

442
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:05,334
Come on, baby
take a chance with us

443
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:14,272
Come on, baby
take a chance with us

444
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,743
Come on, baby
take a chance with us

445
00:50:21,854 --> 00:50:27,086
And meet me at the back
of the blue bus tonight

446
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:29,682
Blue bus tonight

447
00:50:29,795 --> 00:50:32,854
Blue bus tonight
Blue

448
00:50:32,965 --> 00:50:36,365
Come on, yeah

449
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:41,299
We train young men
to drop fire on people...

450
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:44,842
but their commanders...

451
00:50:44,943 --> 00:50:48,503
won't allow them
to write ``fuck''...

452
00:50:48,614 --> 00:50:51,639
on their airplanes because...

453
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,649
it's obscene.

454
00:52:16,435 --> 00:52:18,334
The horror.

455
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,370
The horror.

456
00:57:46,064 --> 00:57:48,088
Calling PBR Street Gang.

457
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:52,502
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Do you read me? Over.

458
00:57:53,939 --> 00:57:56,634
PBR Street Gang?

459
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:58,867
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty--

460
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:38,238
The horror.

461
00:58:42,187 --> 00:58:43,744
The horror.

462
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:13,343
