00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,322
¡± Piano: Chopin's "Nocturne in C Sharp"

2
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:56,558
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

3
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:59,269
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

4
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:03,357
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

5
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:06,068
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

6
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:10,239
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

7
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:13,033
Jurek, where have you been
hiding her?

8
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,957
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

9
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,294
How many suitcases are you taking?

10
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:27,464
What do you think, should I take
uncle Szymon's portrait?

11
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:30,801
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

12
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:33,470
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

13
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,430
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

14
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,601
- I should have another case.
- Mama, Wladek is home!

15
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,064
Thank God.
Wladek! You're wounded?

16
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:47,401
- No, it was nothing.
- I've been worried sick.

17
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:50,154
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

18
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,239
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd know where to take you.

19
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:57,494
Henryk, don't say things like that.
God forbid. God forbid.

20
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,746
- Papa, Wladek is home.
- What did I tell you?

21
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:03,375
- What are you doing?
- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

22
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:08,297
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.
- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

23
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:10,340
Pack, darling.
Get your things packed.

24
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:12,593
- Where are we going?
- Out of Warsaw.

25
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:15,429
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

26
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,307
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?

27
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:20,976
- Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

28
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:23,687
- She used it for packing.
- The government has moved to Lublin.

29
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:28,358
All men must leave the city, go across
the river, set up a new line of defense.

30
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:32,487
There isn't anybody left here, only
the women. The men are all gone.

31
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:35,282
What do you think you'll do while
they set up a new line of defense?

32
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:38,785
- Wonder around with your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

33
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:42,789
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

34
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:45,667
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

35
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:49,171
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to
die in my own home, staying put.

36
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:53,258
- God forbid.
- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

37
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:57,638
...from the BBC in London.
The British government...

38
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:02,184
having received no reply
to the observations presented...

39
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,645
to the German government...

40
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:08,815
has declared war on nazi Germany.

41
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:12,778
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!
- It is expected that...

42
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:22,871
...within the next few hours, France
will make a similar declaration.

43
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:26,500
Poland is no longer alone.

44
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,882
Wonderful, wonderful!

45
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,513
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- It certainly was.

46
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,224
When there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

47
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:45,394
Here's to Great Britain and France!

48
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:49,398
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?
All will be well.

49
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,850
Five thousand and three.

50
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:30,188
- Is that all?
- Yes. It's all we've got left.

51
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,608
- It's 3,003 too much.
- Look.

52
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:37,154
"Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets.

53
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,574
Jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

54
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:45,287
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

55
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:49,249
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

56
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:54,129
We could hide the money. Look here.
We can hide it under the flowerpots.

57
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:57,340
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use try and tested methods.

58
00:05:57,549 --> 00:06:00,010
You know what we did
in the last war?

59
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:04,097
We made a hole in the table leg,
and hid the money in there.

60
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:06,725
- Suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean?

61
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:11,521
Germans go into Jewish homes and
take furniture, valuables, anything.

62
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,524
- Do they?
- Why'd they want a table like this?

63
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:18,778
- What on earth are you doing?
- Listen. Look.

64
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,074
This is the best place. No-one would
think of looking under the flowerpot.

65
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,411
- No, listen. I've been thinking...
- Really? That's a change.

66
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,915
- You know what? We use psychology.
- We use what?

67
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:35,045
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, covered. In full view.

68
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:40,842
- Are you stupid?
- The Germans will never notice it.

69
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:44,971
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

70
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:47,515
Look here.

71
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:49,601
Idiot.

72
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:52,646
- And you call me stupid.
- Very good. That's the last place...

73
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:54,940
- This would take hours.
- We're not in a hurry.

74
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,360
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me.

75
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:01,613
- How will you get them out?
- Quiet! Order, please!

76
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,532
- You reach them out individually.
- No-one listens to me!

77
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:07,577
Quiet, please, quiet.
Order, order, please.

78
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:12,040
- The lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look.

79
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:15,835
The watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin.

80
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,550
- But I'll still be able to play?
- You'll find out.

81
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,471
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek, how are you?

82
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:28,765
We're fine, thank you.
And you?

83
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:34,187
Fine, under the circumstances.
I guess I know why you're calling.

84
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:38,566
There's nothing we can do.
They won't reopen the station.

85
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:43,530
- Yes, I know, but I...
- No music, no radio for the Polish.

86
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:47,075
But sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you.

87
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:49,661
Maybe, maybe not, but...

88
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:54,999
don't be offended, but I didn't call
to discuss my future carrier.

89
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,420
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

90
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:01,798
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
so I came and...

91
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:04,426
they bombed the station.

92
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:08,096
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.
- Really?

93
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:11,766
Yes, it was unforgettable.

94
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:15,603
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
- Call me Wladek, please.

95
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:19,023
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope it's a compliment.

96
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,902
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

97
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:27,407
- Should we go and have a coffee?
- I'd like that.

98
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,745
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

99
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:35,915
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

100
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:38,668
- What instrument?
- The cello.

101
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,463
I love to see women
playing the cello.

102
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:45,884
JEWS FORBIDDEN

103
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:49,345
This is disgraceful.
How dare they?

104
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:52,390
You know what people are like, they
want to be better nazis than Hitler.

105
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:56,478
- I'm going in there to complain.
- It's better not, believe me.

106
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:59,981
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye.

107
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,779
We'll find somewhere else.

108
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,283
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

109
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,828
Official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

110
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:17,165
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

111
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:22,253
We could sit in a bench, but
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

112
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,297
This is absurd.

113
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:30,428
We can just stand here and talk.
I think we're allowed to do that.

114
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:36,017
So, you play the cello. That's nice.
And who's your favorite composer?

115
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:38,519
Chopin? Really? Well...

116
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:41,648
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

117
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:43,983
What about you, Wladek?

118
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,195
Perhaps I could accompany.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

119
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:51,699
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

120
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,995
Call me Wladek, please.

121
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:59,874
"Free emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district.

122
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,002
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

123
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:06,506
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

124
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:11,552
This decree will come into force
on the first of December, 1939...

125
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:15,139
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

126
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,768
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

127
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:22,689
and will represent the blue star
of David on a white background.

128
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:26,401
The background must be
sufficiently large...

129
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:30,363
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

130

The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

131
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:40,623
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

Governor of the Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer. "

133
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:53,094
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.

134
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,183
Let me see this.

135
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:07,316
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

136
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:12,280
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them.

137
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,207
You!

138
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,419
Come here.

139
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,719
Why haven't you greeted us?

140
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:37,805
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:51,110
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

142
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,446
Go to the gutter.

143
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:13,799
- Have you seen this?
- What? What? I'm working. What?

144
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,053
What is this?

145
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:22,016
- It's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean "put us"?

146

00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:37,823
There'll be created a Jewish district
in which Jews will have to reside. "

149
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:42,536
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area...

150
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:48,042
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31 of October, 1940."

151
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:51,504
They won't get all of us.
It's too small.

152
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:53,673
There's 400 thousand of us
in Warsaw.

153
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:57,426
No, 360 thousand.
So it will be easy.

154
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:01,514
What am I supposed to do?
You tell me.

155
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:07,061
Mama?

156
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:10,356
Mama, what is it?

157
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,986
20 zlotys!

158
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,406
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

159
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:25,204
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

160
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:29,834
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

161
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,511
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

162
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,472
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

163
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:47,601
- But it's a Bechstein!
- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

164
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:50,771
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

165
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,774
- Get out!
- What's the matter with you?

166
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,901
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

167
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,280
Haven't you eaten today?
What are you suffering from?

168
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:02,158
You people are crazy.

169
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:06,370
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

170
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,165
I'm not even charging
for the removal!

171
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,626
You haven't eaten today.
You're crazy.

172
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:14,670
Take it.

173
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,915
Hello.

174
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,376
Hello. Hi.

175
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,839
I didn't want to come.

176
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:03,594
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

177
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:05,721
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

178
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,973
Good.

179
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:11,810
No, not really.
They arrested my cousin.

180
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:14,396
Jurek says they'll let him out.

181
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:20,277
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

182
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,405
That's what I said myself.

183
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,325
It's too absurd.

184
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,499
I... I should go.

185
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:38,254
Well, I'll see you...

186
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,214
soon.

187
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:47,012
Good-bye.

188
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,320
Well...

189
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:07,616
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

190
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:18,294
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

191
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:21,463
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

192
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,009
Look.

193
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:28,554
Come and look.

194
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,796
Go away.

195
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,257
Go away! Go away!

196
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:09,511
Papa! Papa!

197
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:28,822
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

198
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:31,658
- 3 zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

199
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:36,121
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

200
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,999
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

201
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:42,669
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

202
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:47,633
They bring cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

203
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,635
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

204
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:53,639
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

205
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:58,101
A tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard.

206
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,815
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

207
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:06,693
Sleep well. But if you see him,
write to me, yes?

208
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:08,946
Izaak Szerman.

209
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:27,172
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

210
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,591
Why can't they go around?

211
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,470
Don't worry. They're about to build
a bridge. Haven't you heard?

212
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,390
A bridge! Those idiots.

213
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,185
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

214
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,939
But do you know what I think?
I think they're totally stupid.

215
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:47,109
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here...

216
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:49,570
waiting for them to let us through.

217
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:53,073
Maybe they think I come here
to listen to the music?

218
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:58,412
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?
- What's wrong with you?

219
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:02,916
- Come on, do something.
- Right. Dance!

220
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,877
- Dance!
- Dance!

221
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:09,006
Come on, come on! Dance!

222
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,052
Very well.

223
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,221
What about you?
Dance with him.

224
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:21,977
Let's clear the street,
so the Jews can dance.

225
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:27,607
Come on. And you.

226
00:19:33,697 --> 00:19:35,365
Go on.

227
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,909
Faster!

228
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,788
Come on!

229
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:44,458
Faster!

230
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,088
Come on!

231
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:53,550
Faster!

232
00:19:55,802 --> 00:20:00,474
Come on, move! I said faster!
Come on, Jews!

233
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:03,685
- Keep dancing.
- Dance.

234
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:24,206
Good, they're here.

235
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,877
Itzak Heller has been
waiting for you.

236
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,635
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

237
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:39,304
I'll start lunch
when the girls get here.

238
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:48,522
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

239
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:54,361
His father is back in the jewellery
business. He's doing well.

240
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:59,366
Amazing, jewellery.

241
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:01,910
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

242
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,579
Don't be clever with me.
I'm coming as a friend.

243
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:06,998
They're bringing Jews in
from all over the country.

244
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:09,251
Soon there will be half million people
in the ghetto.

245
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:13,463
- We need more Jewish police.
- More Jewish police!

246
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,133
You want me to beat up Jews
and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

247
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,886
- Someone has got to do it.
- But why me?

248
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:22,472
I thought you only recruited boys
with rich fathers.

249
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:24,724
Look at my father, look at us...

250
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:28,019
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm
here. You can have a better life.

251
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:31,648
- You want to survive selling books?
- Yes, please.

252
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:35,235
I'm doing you people a favor.

253
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,196
What about you?
You're a great pianist.

254
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:40,907
We've got a police jazz band.
They'd welcome you with open arms.

255
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:44,244
- Join us. You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

256
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:35,462
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

257
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:40,425
Who wants me to stop?

258
00:23:31,684 --> 00:23:33,520
I always say,
look on the bright side.

259
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:37,190
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

260
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:40,902
You're better off than us. Here in
the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

261
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:44,280
- You have to give me something.
- You're an artist...

262
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,491
you keep peoples' spirits up.
You do enough.

263
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:50,286
- I want to help, do something.
- You're too well known.

264
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:55,416
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

265
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:59,712
You're too... too musical.

266
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:06,719
- Who is that?
- Symche.

267
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:09,055
Majorek.

268
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:13,268
There are notices going up. City is
to be cleansed of the undesirables.

269
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:16,479
- There's always notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

270
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:20,900
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

271
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:24,696
Jehuda, working hard?

272
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:28,867
This is the greatest pianist in
Poland. Maybe the whole world.

273
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:32,036
Wladyslaw Szpilman,
meet Majorek.

274
00:24:32,245 --> 00:24:34,080
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

275
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:37,750
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

276
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:42,964
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

277
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,719
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

278
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:51,681
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

279
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:53,892
Five hundred.

280
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:57,437
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

281
00:24:57,645 --> 00:25:02,233
That makes 10 thousand readers.
This will start the uprising.

282
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:05,737
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

283
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:08,781
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

284
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,492
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

285
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,745
They're too clean for them.

286
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:22,462
Please, mister, please.

287
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:54,035
Hold it!
You little bastard!

288
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:58,998
Take this!

289
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:01,209
Stop it! Stop it!

290
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:03,211
Stop it!

291
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:09,175
Come on, come on.
Come on, boy.

292
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:19,185
Stand up! Stand up.

293
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:53,803
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

294
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:57,598
- Enjoy your meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.

295
00:26:57,807 --> 00:27:00,810
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?
- The surgeon.

296
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:05,857
The Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

297
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:09,193
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

298
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:12,864
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so...

299
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:15,408
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

300
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:17,952
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

301
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:22,707
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja
and everybody else who was there.

302
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:27,503
Isn't that a laugh?

303
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:31,632
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

304
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,634
I said nothing bad.

305
00:27:34,343 --> 00:27:38,055
What's the matter with you all?
You lost your sense of humor?

306
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:40,933
It's not funny.

307
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:44,604
You know what's funny? You're
funny, with that ridiculous tie.

308
00:27:45,938 --> 00:27:48,941
What are you talking about? What's
my tie have to do with anything?

309
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:51,402
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

310
00:27:51,652 --> 00:27:55,907
- That's right, I work.
- Playing the piano for the parasites.

311
00:27:56,115 --> 00:27:59,285
- Parasites...
- Boys. Boys!

312
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:02,038
- They don't give a damn.
- And you blame me for their apathy?

313
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:05,750
I see it everyday. They don't even
notice what's going around them.

314
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,960
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

315
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:11,297
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

316
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,593
What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying.

317
00:28:15,801 --> 00:28:18,137
Haven't got a bite to eat.

318
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:23,601
The Jewish bankers should persuade
America to declare war on Germany.

319
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:42,703
The lights! The lights!

320
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:04,892
Turn on the lights.

321
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,231
Come on!

322
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,488
Open the door!
We want to go in!

323
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:21,367
Open the door!

324
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:37,216
Stand up!

325
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:42,972
You, stand up! Come on!

326
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:46,183
Throw him out!

327
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:01,532
Mama...

328
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,381
Come on, run!

329
00:31:24,073 --> 00:31:28,619
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Go in. Not you.

330
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,516
- What?
- Come. It's terrible.

331
00:31:50,724 --> 00:31:53,894
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

332
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:56,313
They've taken Henryk.

333
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:00,943
Go home, alright? Go home,
I'll take care of it.

334
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:16,333
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

335
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:20,421
- I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

336
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:24,299
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

337
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:36,061
What happened here?

338
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:40,023
They've got my grandson. They
pick them up and take them away.

339
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:43,986
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

340
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,656
Excuse me. Excuse me.

341
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:50,576
Itzak?

342
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:52,703
Itzak?

343
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:56,415
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

344
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:05,257
- Henryk is in there.
- I haven't seen him.

345
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:07,593
Believe me.
They picked him up.

346
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,934
- Can you help?
- Now you need me. Now you need me!

347
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:18,353
Can you help us?

348
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:21,732
- It costs.
- I have no money.

349
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,568
Then there's nothing I can do.
You should have joined us.

350
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:29,156
- They told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

351
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:32,910
People I know. They said
you're an important man.

352
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:38,040
Itzak...

353
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,892
- Hands up.
- How are you?

354
00:33:57,142 --> 00:34:00,812
- How are you?
- You, bandit.

355
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:03,232
Dead! Dead!

356
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,610
- He's crazy.
- Hands up.

357
00:34:06,818 --> 00:34:09,947
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

358
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:13,492
Thank you.

359
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,121
Everything is alright!

360
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,457
He looks very happy.

361
00:34:20,707 --> 00:34:23,543
Everything is alright.

362
00:34:23,794 --> 00:34:27,172
Everything is alright.

363
00:34:27,756 --> 00:34:31,301
Hands up! Hands up!

364
00:34:31,843 --> 00:34:33,178
It's alright.

365
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:37,182
Help! Help!

366
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:41,061
Let go! Help!

367
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:37,784
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Itzak Heller?

368
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:41,538
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

369
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:46,668
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?
- I asked him to help you.

370
00:35:47,335 --> 00:35:49,546
What did you pay him?

371
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:55,010
With what could I pay him? Every
zloty I earn we spend on food.

372
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,305
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

373
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:02,434
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

374
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:05,937
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

375
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:10,275
- You're mad. That's your trouble.
- That's also my business.

376
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:22,871
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

377
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:26,291
Hungry.

378
00:36:33,507 --> 00:36:37,844
Employment certificate. What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

379
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:40,889
You have to have an
employment certificate...

380
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:43,683
to work for the Germans
in the ghetto, otherwise...

381
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:46,728
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

382
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:50,315
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

383
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:54,361
and send us to labor camps,
in the East.

384
00:36:56,238 --> 00:36:59,241
- They're closing the small ghetto.
- Oh, God!

385
00:37:14,547 --> 00:37:16,466
Wladek? Wladek?

386
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,429
I thought you were on tour playing
in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

387
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:24,432
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

388
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:27,602
Have you heard the rumors? They're
going to resettle us in the East.

389
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:31,982
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart. What's the trouble?

390
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:36,569
I've been trying to get the certificate
of employment for my father.

391
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:40,198
I managed to get one for me and my
family, but I need one for my father.

392
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:43,576
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

393
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,954
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

394
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:48,623
I'm not, but Majorek is.

395
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,919
Can you help?
I have no money.

396
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:56,548
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

397
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:59,134
Be at the Schultz workshop
tomorrow, four o'clock.

398
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:02,095
See what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

399
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:06,182
That's the historical imperative in
action! That's why I always say:

400
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:08,810
- "Look on the bright side!"
- Yes, I know.

401
00:38:21,948 --> 00:38:24,492
- How's your back?
- Better.

402
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:26,703
Better?

403
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,872
Better not ask.

404
00:38:41,926 --> 00:38:47,057
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

405
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,853
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

406
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:05,927
At least we got work
in the ghetto.

407
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:09,264
At least we are still together.

408
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:25,947
Everybody out!
To the courtyard!

409
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:28,533
Move, move!

410
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:33,496
We are workers. We have
employment certification.

411
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,460
Wait.

412
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:41,170
Here.

413
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:44,632
Go over there. Hurry.

414
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:46,801
You.

415
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:49,887
You. You.

416
00:40:51,723 --> 00:40:53,474
You.

417
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:57,103
You.

418
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:00,732
You.

419
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:12,994
The others, put your clothes on
and come back here.

420
00:41:13,202 --> 00:41:16,372
Bring your things with you.
15 kilos only.

421
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:19,500
Where are you taking us?

422
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:45,777
I'm sorry, I did my best.

423
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:51,157
- I thought the certificates'd save us.
- Stop it, Wladek.

424
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:54,952
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

425
00:42:22,522 --> 00:42:24,816
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

426
00:42:24,982 --> 00:42:28,444
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

427
00:42:33,032 --> 00:42:36,994
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

428
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:43,084
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

429
00:42:44,377 --> 00:42:47,922
Why did I do it?

430
00:43:31,132 --> 00:43:33,843
Don't you have a bottle of water?
He's dying.

431
00:43:34,051 --> 00:43:35,970
My child is dying of thirst.

432
00:43:36,137 --> 00:43:38,055
- I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

433
00:43:38,222 --> 00:43:42,143
- Don't you have water? I beg you.
- Can you hear what I'm saying?

434
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:44,687
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

435
00:43:44,895 --> 00:43:47,189
Letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter.

436
00:43:47,356 --> 00:43:49,525
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

437
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:52,945
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

438
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:55,865
At least we can die honorably, not
as a stain on the face of History.

439
00:43:56,073 --> 00:43:58,743
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

440
00:43:58,993 --> 00:44:01,537
You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

441
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:05,791
- They're going to wipe us all out.
- What do you want me to do? Fight?

442
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:08,627
To fight, we need organization,
plans, guns.

443
00:44:08,794 --> 00:44:11,464
He's right. Do you think I'm going
to fight with my violin bowl?

444
00:44:11,672 --> 00:44:14,508
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

445
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:17,136
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

446
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:18,721
Sure.

447
00:44:18,888 --> 00:44:23,351
Look at that cripple, the old people,
the children. They're going to work?

448
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:27,313
Look at you. You're going to carry
logs on your back?

449
00:45:09,313 --> 00:45:12,608
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

450
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:26,956
I missed you.
I wanted to be with you!

451
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:38,300
I wanted to be with you!

452
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:40,594
Stupid. Stupid.

453
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:45,224
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

454
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:48,686
She's getting on my nerves.

455
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:57,653
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

456
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:03,242
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

457
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,328
The baby cried
just as the police came.

458
00:46:06,537 --> 00:46:10,666
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

459
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:15,713
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

460
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:43,157
What are you reading?

461
00:46:45,576 --> 00:46:50,456
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

462
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,875
If you poison us, do we not die?

463
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:56,253
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

464
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:07,389
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

465
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,869
Idiot. What does he think
he's gonna do with the money?

466
00:47:29,953 --> 00:47:32,664
Boy, come here.

467
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:35,209
Come here.

468
00:47:36,543 --> 00:47:38,545
- How much for a caramel?
- 20 zlotys.

469
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:42,216
For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

470
00:47:42,424 --> 00:47:44,718
20 zlotys.

471
00:47:46,303 --> 00:47:48,472
We've got 20 between us.

472
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:51,266
I've got 10, I think.

473
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:56,772
5, 10, 20.

474
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:22,316
- Halina?
- What?

475
00:49:23,692 --> 00:49:27,654
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

476
00:49:28,697 --> 00:49:32,200
I wish I knew you better.

477
00:49:34,953 --> 00:49:36,997
Thank you.

478
00:49:53,388 --> 00:49:55,057
Szpilman?

479
00:50:04,775 --> 00:50:07,194
Papa? Papa?

480
00:50:09,613 --> 00:50:11,990
Mama? Halina?

481
00:50:12,616 --> 00:50:15,160
Halina? Mama?

482
00:50:15,827 --> 00:50:20,832
What do you think you're doing?
I've saved your life. Just go! Go!

483
00:50:24,419 --> 00:50:26,713
Don't run!

484
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,384
Anna!

485
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:32,928
Anna!

486
00:50:52,656 --> 00:50:55,784
Off they go to the melting pot.

487
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:03,625
- This stays.
- Give it to me!

488
00:51:08,713 --> 00:51:11,425
What are you doing?
She's pregnant.

489
00:53:38,488 --> 00:53:40,448
Wladek?

490
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:01,719
Why are you here, Wladek?

491
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:04,597
It's like this, I...

492
00:54:06,266 --> 00:54:08,184
We...

493
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:13,398
All of them, all of them.

494
00:54:13,565 --> 00:54:15,817
All of them.

495
00:54:16,985 --> 00:54:20,905
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

496
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:24,325
It's not finished yet. We'll stay
here for a couple of days...

497
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:26,494
until things die down.

498
00:54:26,703 --> 00:54:30,248
I've bribed the policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

499
00:54:32,459 --> 00:54:36,171
Attention!
On the march!

500
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:48,141
Onward!

501
00:54:50,518 --> 00:54:53,688
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

502
00:54:53,897 --> 00:54:56,900
Don't get overexcited.

503
00:55:12,832 --> 00:55:16,085
It's gold.
Very good price.

504
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:39,067
Someone you know?

505
00:55:39,234 --> 00:55:41,236
A beauty.
Who is she?

506
00:55:41,444 --> 00:55:45,573
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband is an actor.

507
00:55:45,782 --> 00:55:48,201
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

508
00:55:48,368 --> 00:55:52,246
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

509
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:21,484
Turn left!

510
00:56:21,693 --> 00:56:24,153
On the march!

511
00:56:28,366 --> 00:56:31,119
Stop! Halt!
Attention!

512
00:56:38,459 --> 00:56:41,379
At ease.

513
00:56:45,466 --> 00:56:48,261
Turn right!

514
00:56:55,435 --> 00:56:58,146
Step forward.

515
00:56:58,688 --> 00:57:00,273
You.

516
00:57:02,525 --> 00:57:05,153
You. You.

517
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,655
You.

518
00:57:11,617 --> 00:57:13,703
Down on the ground!

519
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:17,039
Down on the ground!

520
00:57:44,317 --> 00:57:46,444
Turn left!

521
00:57:47,612 --> 00:57:50,072
On the march.

522
00:58:30,112 --> 00:58:32,365
How long have you been here?

523
00:58:32,615 --> 00:58:35,493
Since last night.

524
00:58:35,743 --> 00:58:38,120
I was pleased to see you.

525
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:45,378
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

526
00:58:47,255 --> 00:58:49,548
We know what it means.

527
00:58:50,633 --> 00:58:54,553
We sent someone out.
Zygmund, a good man.

528
00:58:57,098 --> 00:59:00,559
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

529
00:59:01,894 --> 00:59:04,105
He got to Sokolow.

530
00:59:04,355 --> 00:59:09,068
A man told him the tracks divided,
one branch's leading to Treblinka.

531
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,699
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

532
00:59:14,907 --> 00:59:18,911
branch off to Treblinka
and return empty.

533
00:59:19,078 --> 00:59:22,123
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

534
00:59:22,957 --> 00:59:26,377
The civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

535
00:59:30,423 --> 00:59:32,758
They're exterminating us.

536
00:59:36,554 --> 00:59:39,223
It won't take them long.

537
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:44,186
We are 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

538
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:47,565
Mostly young people.

539
00:59:48,816 --> 00:59:51,902
And this time we're gonna fight.

540
00:59:53,654 --> 00:59:56,449
We're in good shape.

541
00:59:56,657 --> 01:00:00,619
Organized.
We're prepared.

542
01:00:00,786 --> 01:00:03,664
If you need help, I...

543
01:00:23,142 --> 01:00:26,479
You! Come here!

544
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:29,315
Shit!

545
01:00:37,364 --> 01:00:39,742
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

546
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:43,412
I don't know what I was thinking.

547
01:00:52,671 --> 01:00:57,092
Take this! Take this!

548
01:01:11,774 --> 01:01:14,610
Take him away.

549
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,921
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

550
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:38,133
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

551
01:01:38,342 --> 01:01:41,262
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

552
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:05,703
Trouble.

553
01:02:05,953 --> 01:02:08,455
Round up only the Jews!

554
01:02:08,706 --> 01:02:11,625
Round up!
Only the Jews.

555
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:15,254
The Polish keep working.
Only the Jews.

556
01:02:22,553 --> 01:02:25,514
I have good news for you.

557
01:02:25,723 --> 01:02:30,644
There are rumors going around
that we like to...

558
01:02:30,853 --> 01:02:33,772
to resettle you.

559
01:02:35,691 --> 01:02:40,738
I promise you that now
and in the future...

560
01:02:40,946 --> 01:02:44,533
nothing else is planned.

561
01:02:45,576 --> 01:02:51,874
For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

562
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:56,587
To show you our goodwill...

563
01:02:56,754 --> 01:03:00,716
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

564
01:03:00,924 --> 01:03:03,927
to go in town daily...

565
01:03:04,344 --> 01:03:10,517
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

566
01:03:10,768 --> 01:03:15,230
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

567
01:03:15,397 --> 01:03:20,861
So, why should we do something
like this if we'd resettle you?

568
01:03:22,112 --> 01:03:27,451
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

569
01:03:28,952 --> 01:03:34,625
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Making money?

570
01:03:38,629 --> 01:03:39,755
Dismiss them.

571
01:03:56,104 --> 01:04:00,067
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

572
01:05:08,802 --> 01:05:10,012
Now!

573
01:05:47,549 --> 01:05:49,509
Majorek.

574
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:54,181
I have a favor to ask.

575
01:05:54,848 --> 01:05:57,184
I want to get out of here.

576
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:04,399
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll
survive on the other side that's hard.

577
01:06:04,608 --> 01:06:06,943
I know.

578
01:06:07,694 --> 01:06:11,573
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

579
01:06:11,782 --> 01:06:15,285
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

580
01:06:15,452 --> 01:06:18,955
A singer, her husband
is an actor.

581
01:06:20,499 --> 01:06:24,586
I've filled their names down and
their address, if they're still there.

582
01:06:24,753 --> 01:06:29,716
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. They're good people.

583
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:33,678
Would you try to make contact?

584
01:06:34,805 --> 01:06:40,560
You go to town everyday. Ask them
if they'd help me get out of here.

585
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:16,221
Have you got any plaster?

586
01:07:25,564 --> 01:07:28,817
What are you up to?

587
01:07:30,443 --> 01:07:32,946
What have you got there?

588
01:07:33,154 --> 01:07:37,117
We are allowed to take
food to the ghetto.

589
01:07:37,325 --> 01:07:40,161
Three kilos of potato and bread.

590
01:07:40,328 --> 01:07:42,455
Open it.

591
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:51,214
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying. That's not true.

592
01:07:52,632 --> 01:07:54,843
Open it.

593
01:08:22,787 --> 01:08:24,956
Potatoes!

594
01:08:28,626 --> 01:08:31,671
You Jews are all alike.

595
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,592
We reach you with a finger...

596
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,803
and you take the whole hand.

597
01:08:52,108 --> 01:08:56,446
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill you. Personally.

598
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:22,722
I've tried your friends.

599
01:09:22,889 --> 01:09:26,309
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

600
01:09:26,893 --> 01:09:28,978
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

601
01:09:29,187 --> 01:09:31,106
- Soon.
- Halt!

602
01:09:32,816 --> 01:09:34,734
Shit! Shit!

603
01:09:34,943 --> 01:09:37,570
Wait. What's going on here?

604
01:09:37,821 --> 01:09:41,449
Take this! Take this!

605
01:09:47,705 --> 01:09:51,751
I'll teach you some discipline,
you dirty Jews.

606
01:09:56,131 --> 01:09:58,466
Do you know why
you're being hit?

607
01:09:58,633 --> 01:10:01,803
- No.
- Do you know why you're being hit?

608
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:06,558
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year.

609
01:10:08,852 --> 01:10:11,104
On the march!

610
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:13,940
March and sing!

611
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:16,109
Sing something nice!

612
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:19,821
Loud and clear!

613
01:10:20,697 --> 01:10:24,701
Reunite tonight
And follow the white eagle

614
01:10:24,909 --> 01:10:28,997
Stand up and fight
Our mortal enemies

615
01:10:29,163 --> 01:10:33,042
Rise on the day
Let's give them fire and brimstone

616
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:37,213
We'll do away
The Yoke of slavery

617
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:41,175
Punish and rout
The rapists of our nation

618
01:10:41,342 --> 01:10:45,513
We'll slash them out
To save our dignity

619
01:11:19,172 --> 01:11:21,215
Come.

620
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:37,458
I'm sorry.

621
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:40,419
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

622
01:13:05,486 --> 01:13:08,447
We haven't much time.
Come on.

623
01:13:16,122 --> 01:13:17,999
We must hurry.

624
01:13:18,124 --> 01:13:20,501
Here. See if this fit.

625
01:13:20,751 --> 01:13:24,881
We have to keep moving you. Germans
are hunting down indiscriminately.

626
01:13:25,089 --> 01:13:28,301
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

627
01:13:28,467 --> 01:13:32,430
You better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

628
01:13:47,361 --> 01:13:50,323
You'll be looked after
by Gebczynski.

629
01:13:50,531 --> 01:13:52,533
He's on the other side of town.

630
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:56,537
You stay there tonight,
then we'll find you somewhere else.

631
01:13:56,996 --> 01:14:01,500
- I'll bring you food.
- Alright, let's go.

632
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:43,709
I'll show you where
you're going to sleep.

633
01:15:14,115 --> 01:15:17,034
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

634
01:15:17,243 --> 01:15:22,164
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

635
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:31,966
It's not going to be very comfortable.

636
01:15:32,508 --> 01:15:34,510
I'll be fine.

637
01:15:44,478 --> 01:15:46,605
Thank you.

638
01:16:02,037 --> 01:16:04,748
Here. Here. Give it to me.

639
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:09,336
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

640
01:16:27,688 --> 01:16:29,481
DO NOT PASS

641
01:17:00,846 --> 01:17:03,349
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

642
01:17:08,896 --> 01:17:12,608
But you leave them open
during the day. Don't forget.

643
01:17:15,569 --> 01:17:18,989
Must feel better on
this side of the wall, eh?

644
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:20,699
Yes.

645
01:17:21,992 --> 01:17:26,538
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

646
01:17:28,415 --> 01:17:32,044
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

647
01:17:32,294 --> 01:17:35,673
I'll come again.
Janina will visit you twice a week.

648
01:17:35,839 --> 01:17:38,384
To bring more food,
see how you are.

649
01:17:38,717 --> 01:17:40,844
Thank you.

650
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:46,392
This is very important.
In case of emergency...

651
01:17:46,642 --> 01:17:50,896
I mean emergency,
go to this address.

652
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,649
What do you mean you forgot?

653
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:38,819
What do you think I mean?
I forgot, that's what I mean.

654
01:18:38,944 --> 01:18:44,575
- You know, you treat me like dirt.
- Because you are a dirt.

655
01:18:44,783 --> 01:18:47,202
- Pig! Pig!
- Bitch!

656
01:18:47,411 --> 01:18:50,205
- Dirty pig!
- You are a dirty pig!

657
01:18:50,414 --> 01:18:53,125
Takes one to know one. Pig.

658
01:18:57,212 --> 01:19:02,050
- You play like an angel.
- Then why don't you listen?

659
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:04,470
- I'm listening.
- Liar.

660
01:19:04,636 --> 01:19:08,015
You fell asleep. Pig.

661
01:19:29,369 --> 01:19:33,415
Spread out!
We're being attacked!

662
01:19:35,876 --> 01:19:38,295
Take cover!

663
01:19:39,963 --> 01:19:40,964
Shoot!

664
01:19:53,101 --> 01:19:55,979
Take cover! Fire!

665
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:02,945
Come on, get out!

666
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:32,743
The attack was successful.

667
01:21:34,786 --> 01:21:36,997
That building...

668
01:21:44,796 --> 01:21:46,882
Turn that way!

669
01:21:53,555 --> 01:21:55,474
Shoot!

670
01:22:19,748 --> 01:22:21,708
Thank you.

671
01:22:24,878 --> 01:22:28,089
- I wanted to come earlier, but...
- No, thank you.

672
01:22:32,177 --> 01:22:35,972
No-one thought
they'd hold out so long.

673
01:22:36,139 --> 01:22:38,725
I never should've come out. I should
have stayed and fought with them.

674
01:22:38,934 --> 01:22:42,354
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

675
01:22:42,521 --> 01:22:45,440
Just be proud of them.

676
01:22:45,649 --> 01:22:49,194
- My God, did they put up a fight!
- Yes.

677
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:54,115
- So did the Germans.
- They are in shock!

678
01:22:54,324 --> 01:23:00,080
They didn't expect it. Nobody
expected it. Jews fighting back.

679
01:23:00,247 --> 01:23:05,043
- Who would have thought?
- What good did it do?

680
01:23:05,252 --> 01:23:07,295
What good?

681
01:23:07,504 --> 01:23:09,881
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

682
01:23:10,048 --> 01:23:14,886
They died with dignity.
And you know something else?

683
01:23:15,804 --> 01:23:19,975
Now the Poles will rise.
We are ready.

684
01:23:20,183 --> 01:23:23,603
We'll fight too.
You'll see.

685
01:23:37,867 --> 01:23:40,495
Get your things together.
You have to leave.

686
01:23:40,704 --> 01:23:43,331
What? What's happened?

687
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:48,086
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?

688
01:23:48,294 --> 01:23:52,382
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

689
01:23:53,299 --> 01:23:57,178
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

690
01:23:57,387 --> 01:23:59,764
Where do you want me to go?

691
01:23:59,931 --> 01:24:03,476
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

692
01:24:04,561 --> 01:24:07,939
- Can I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

693
01:24:08,106 --> 01:24:10,900
But when they storm the flat,
throw yourself out the window...

694
01:24:11,109 --> 01:24:12,944
don't let them get you alive.

695
01:24:13,111 --> 01:24:16,364
I have poison on me.
They won't get me alive either.

696
01:27:32,477 --> 01:27:34,771
Open up!

697
01:27:37,482 --> 01:27:41,778
Open the door
or we'll call the police!

698
01:28:09,722 --> 01:28:13,810
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

699
01:28:14,018 --> 01:28:17,230
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just
came to visit, but I missed him.

700
01:28:17,396 --> 01:28:19,899
Have you got your identity card?

701
01:28:20,483 --> 01:28:23,444
- Let me see your identity card.
- Yes, of course.

702
01:28:26,155 --> 01:28:28,616
- I want to see your identity card!
- What's happening?

703
01:28:28,825 --> 01:28:31,494
He's a Jew! A Jew!

704
01:28:31,702 --> 01:28:33,579
Stop the Jew!

705
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:37,333
Don't let him out!
Stop him!

706
01:29:50,656 --> 01:29:54,869
- Yes?
- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

707
01:30:01,042 --> 01:30:05,046
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.
- Dorota.

708
01:30:06,339 --> 01:30:08,341
Come in.

709
01:30:15,348 --> 01:30:16,974
I'm sorry.

710
01:30:17,183 --> 01:30:20,644
I was given this address and
I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

711
01:30:20,853 --> 01:30:24,523
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

712
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:26,442
Come in.

713
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:36,452
Sit.

714
01:30:39,413 --> 01:30:41,749
I need help.

715
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,504
He'll be back before curfew.

716
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:49,256
I've been in hiding.

717
01:30:50,424 --> 01:30:53,969
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

718
01:30:56,138 --> 01:30:59,308
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

719
01:31:02,144 --> 01:31:04,772
And how is Jurek?

720
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:06,649
Dead.

721
01:31:13,364 --> 01:31:17,201
- When is your baby due?
- Christmas.

722
01:31:17,827 --> 01:31:21,622
This is not a good time to
have children, but then...

723
01:31:23,874 --> 01:31:27,378
This is my husband.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.

724
01:31:27,545 --> 01:31:32,383
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Yes, I remember.

725
01:31:34,218 --> 01:31:36,929
He said to contact you
only in case of emergency.

726
01:31:37,137 --> 01:31:39,014
Don't worry now.

727
01:31:47,982 --> 01:31:52,194
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

728
01:31:56,907 --> 01:31:58,742
Excuse me.

729
01:32:02,663 --> 01:32:05,708
I'm sorry,
could I have a piece of bread?

730
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:08,669
Yes, of course.
We will eat.

731
01:32:09,378 --> 01:32:13,007
Sit. Please, sit.

732
01:32:13,215 --> 01:32:15,009
Thank you.

733
01:34:23,137 --> 01:34:26,181
You're on a very German area.

734
01:34:26,431 --> 01:34:30,811
On the opposite is a hospital taking
wounded from the Russian front.

735
01:34:32,729 --> 01:34:36,024
And next door is the
Schutzpolizei.

736
01:34:37,442 --> 01:34:39,820
Safest place to be.

737
01:34:40,028 --> 01:34:42,906
Right at the heart
of the lion's den.

738
01:34:48,036 --> 01:34:50,205
I'll be locking you in.

739
01:34:50,372 --> 01:34:54,418
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

740
01:37:04,005 --> 01:37:05,966
All well?

741
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:08,802
Thank you.

742
01:37:13,014 --> 01:37:16,852
This is Antek Szalas.
He'll be looking after you.

743
01:37:17,018 --> 01:37:18,854
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

744
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:20,856
Thank you.

745
01:37:21,106 --> 01:37:26,069
I've given him a second key. He'll
bring food, see that you're alright.

746
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:29,197
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

747
01:37:33,285 --> 01:37:37,497
- You don't remember me?
- I don't think so.

748
01:37:37,706 --> 01:37:41,209
Warsaw Radio.
I was a technician.

749
01:37:41,793 --> 01:37:45,005
I saw you almost everyday.

750
01:37:45,547 --> 01:37:49,050
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- It doesn't matter.

751
01:37:51,303 --> 01:37:54,973
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

752
01:37:55,807 --> 01:37:58,602
You'll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

753
01:37:58,768 --> 01:38:00,812
night after night,
after night.

754
01:38:01,021 --> 01:38:03,523
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

755
01:38:03,773 --> 01:38:07,068
And the Russians are giving them
hell. It's the beginning of the end.

756
01:38:07,277 --> 01:38:08,862
Let's hope so.

757
01:38:19,789 --> 01:38:21,958
Come here.

758
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:24,336
Be careful with it.

759
01:38:25,253 --> 01:38:28,214
That's it. Be careful.

760
01:38:54,949 --> 01:38:57,827
Still alive then?

761
01:39:01,164 --> 01:39:05,335
Here. Sausage, bread.

762
01:39:05,585 --> 01:39:07,754
You still got that vodka?

763
01:39:22,143 --> 01:39:26,064
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long now.

764
01:39:26,606 --> 01:39:29,776
I think I've got jaundice.

765
01:39:30,026 --> 01:39:33,822
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

766
01:39:34,948 --> 01:39:38,952
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

767
01:39:39,202 --> 01:39:41,121
Drink up.

768
01:39:41,913 --> 01:39:44,958
Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks...

769
01:39:45,208 --> 01:39:46,960
Problems.

770
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:49,295
Money.

771
01:39:49,671 --> 01:39:52,340
I've got to raise money
to buy the food.

772
01:39:52,549 --> 01:39:56,428
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.

773
01:40:00,265 --> 01:40:02,934
Here. Sell this.

774
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:07,522
Food is more important than time.

775
01:40:12,735 --> 01:40:15,864
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

776
01:40:16,072 --> 01:40:18,324
Russians will be here soon.

777
01:40:18,825 --> 01:40:21,828
They'll beat the shit
out of the Germans...

778
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,664
any day now.

779
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:10,668
Wladek?

780
01:41:19,969 --> 01:41:23,014
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

781
01:41:25,266 --> 01:41:27,560
- I'll get a doctor.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

782
01:41:27,769 --> 01:41:31,439
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

783
01:41:31,606 --> 01:41:34,108
- He's still a doctor.
- No.

784
01:41:34,317 --> 01:41:37,487
You stay. I'll go.

785
01:42:10,603 --> 01:42:13,439
We came to say goodbye.

786
01:42:13,648 --> 01:42:16,651
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

787
01:42:16,901 --> 01:42:20,196
The baby is already there.
It's safer.

788
01:42:20,363 --> 01:42:24,492
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

789
01:42:25,785 --> 01:42:28,788
That man Szalas should be shot.

790
01:42:29,372 --> 01:42:33,501
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

791
01:42:34,335 --> 01:42:39,382
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

792
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:46,556
My God.

793
01:42:49,726 --> 01:42:55,022
The liver the size of a football.
Inflammation of the gall bladder...

794
01:42:55,732 --> 01:42:58,151
but he'll leave.

795
01:43:00,194 --> 01:43:04,449
I'll try to get him some laevulose,
but it's not easy.

796
01:43:04,699 --> 01:43:08,327
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows.

797
01:43:08,536 --> 01:43:12,665
- Doctor, thank you.
- Don't speak, rest.

798
01:43:16,252 --> 01:43:18,796
Thank you so much for coming.

799
01:43:20,423 --> 01:43:22,675
We've brought you some food.

800
01:43:22,884 --> 01:43:26,721
I'll prepare something now
for you, then we must go.

801
01:44:08,304 --> 01:44:10,640
I'll throw a grenade!

802
01:44:18,898 --> 01:44:21,442
There's a wounded man over there!

803
01:44:21,943 --> 01:44:24,487
Come.

804
01:44:24,612 --> 01:44:27,031
Watch out! Watch out!

805
01:44:28,199 --> 01:44:31,118
- I'll go get help!
- Hurry!

806
01:44:31,786 --> 01:44:35,790
Come on! Bring the litter!

807
01:44:39,669 --> 01:44:42,254
Go back inside!

808
01:46:31,322 --> 01:46:33,991
Get out, get out in the streets!

809
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:37,995
Get out now! The Germans
have surrounded the building!

810
01:47:19,078 --> 01:47:23,415
Somebody...
Somebody help me!

811
01:48:21,265 --> 01:48:24,476
Are you alright?
There's too much dust.

812
01:48:24,852 --> 01:48:29,398
I'll check this side.
Don't worry.

813
01:48:29,648 --> 01:48:32,067
Be careful!

814
01:48:37,489 --> 01:48:40,159
- Heinrich?
- I'm checking!

815
01:48:42,745 --> 01:48:45,247
Is there anybody here?

816
01:48:49,334 --> 01:48:53,464
- Come on down!
- Alright, I'm coming.

817
01:53:01,711 --> 01:53:03,547
Come on, pile them up.

818
01:53:09,886 --> 01:53:12,055
Throw it.

819
01:54:36,348 --> 01:54:39,309
We have to mark everything.

820
01:54:40,352 --> 01:54:41,311
Come on.

821
02:01:42,481 --> 02:01:44,900
What are you doing here?

822
02:01:49,321 --> 02:01:51,657
Who are you?

823
02:01:55,786 --> 02:01:59,373
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

824
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,752
What are you doing?

825
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:11,510
I was...

826
02:02:11,677 --> 02:02:14,722
trying to open this can.

827
02:02:15,431 --> 02:02:18,058
Do you live here?

828
02:02:20,519 --> 02:02:22,479
Do you work here?

829
02:02:22,688 --> 02:02:24,356
No.

830
02:02:28,027 --> 02:02:30,529
What do you do for a living?

831
02:02:33,574 --> 02:02:35,367
I am...

832
02:02:37,036 --> 02:02:39,997
I was a pianist.

833
02:02:42,124 --> 02:02:44,335
Pianist?

834
02:03:03,103 --> 02:03:05,105
Come.

835
02:03:30,089 --> 02:03:32,299
Play something.

836
02:08:51,534 --> 02:08:54,287
Are you hiding here?

837
02:08:59,042 --> 02:09:00,752
Jew?

838
02:09:03,755 --> 02:09:06,132
Where are you hiding yourself?

839
02:09:07,801 --> 02:09:09,803
In the attic.

840
02:09:13,056 --> 02:09:15,350
Show it to me.

841
02:09:38,832 --> 02:09:41,126
Have you got anything to eat?

842
02:10:27,505 --> 02:10:33,052
According to them,
it's very important that...

843
02:10:39,809 --> 02:10:41,603
Attention!

844
02:10:43,271 --> 02:10:46,316
- At ease.
- At ease.

845
02:11:51,547 --> 02:11:53,549
Jew?

846
02:12:08,022 --> 02:12:09,440
Please.

847
02:12:09,857 --> 02:12:11,901
What does it mean,
all that shooting?

848
02:12:12,485 --> 02:12:15,238
The Russians,
on the other side of the river.

849
02:12:16,572 --> 02:12:20,034
You just have to hold on
a couple of weeks, not more.

850
02:13:51,542 --> 02:13:54,337
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

851
02:13:57,298 --> 02:14:00,593
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

852
02:14:03,513 --> 02:14:07,391
I don't know how to thank you.

853
02:14:08,851 --> 02:14:11,062
Thank God, not me.

854
02:14:11,521 --> 02:14:17,109
He wants us to survive. At least,
we have to believe in that.

855
02:14:26,953 --> 02:14:30,289
Here. Take it.

856
02:14:31,332 --> 02:14:35,670
- And you?
- I have another one. Warmer.

857
02:14:40,091 --> 02:14:43,636
What are you going to do
when this is over?

858
02:14:45,471 --> 02:14:49,809
I'll play piano again at
the Polish radio station.

859
02:14:50,685 --> 02:14:52,478
Tell me your name.

860
02:14:52,687 --> 02:14:55,356
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

861
02:14:55,523 --> 02:14:57,650
Szpilman.

862
02:15:01,862 --> 02:15:04,740
Perfect name for a pianist.

863
02:16:27,031 --> 02:16:29,700
German! German!

864
02:16:52,807 --> 02:16:55,476
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!

865
02:16:56,519 --> 02:16:58,521
I'm Polish!

866
02:16:59,355 --> 02:17:02,024
- Come out with your hands up!
- Please! I beg of you!

867
02:17:02,733 --> 02:17:07,446
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
I beg you, I'm a Polish.

868
02:17:07,655 --> 02:17:09,615
Come down!

869
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:17,289
Please, I'm Polish.
Please.

870
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:19,708
He's Polish.

871
02:17:22,545 --> 02:17:24,839
Yes, he's Polish.

872
02:17:26,090 --> 02:17:28,509
Why the fucking coat?

873
02:17:29,593 --> 02:17:31,887
I'm cold.

874
02:17:50,864 --> 02:17:53,867
Look at them.
German fuckers!

875
02:17:54,451 --> 02:17:57,454
Murderers! Murderers!

876
02:17:57,705 --> 02:18:00,916
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

877
02:18:01,125 --> 02:18:04,587
- Bastards!
- Look at you now!

878
02:18:04,795 --> 02:18:08,716
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician.

879
02:18:08,924 --> 02:18:12,344
You took my violin,
you took my soul.

880
02:18:17,224 --> 02:18:18,892
Musician?

881
02:18:20,102 --> 02:18:22,062
Are you a musician?

882
02:18:23,063 --> 02:18:25,190
Do you know...

883
02:18:25,524 --> 02:18:28,694
a pianist called Szpilman,
from the Polish radio station?

884
02:18:28,944 --> 02:18:34,116
- Of course I know him.
- I helped him to hide himself.

885
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:37,077
Tell him I'm here.

886
02:18:37,828 --> 02:18:40,039
Ask him to help me.

887
02:18:43,125 --> 02:18:45,836
- What's your name?
- Hosenfeld.

888
02:18:46,128 --> 02:18:47,338
What?

889
02:20:29,398 --> 02:20:32,025
It was here, I'm certain of it.

890
02:20:33,986 --> 02:20:36,196
Well, it's not here now.

891
02:20:36,405 --> 02:20:40,492
I shouted, abused them.
I'm not proud of it, but that's what I did.

892
02:20:40,742 --> 02:20:42,202
I stood where you are now.

893
02:20:43,412 --> 02:20:46,707
There was a barbed wire
and this German came up to me.

894
02:20:48,041 --> 02:20:51,712
- You didn't catch his name?
- No.

895
02:20:53,881 --> 02:20:57,175
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.
